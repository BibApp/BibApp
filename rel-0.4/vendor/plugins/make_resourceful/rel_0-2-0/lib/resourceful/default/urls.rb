    # This file contains various methods to make URL helpers less painful.
    # They provide methods analogous to the standard foo_url and foo_path helpers.
    # However, they use make_resourceful's knowledge of the structure of the controller
    # to allow you to avoid figuring out which method to call and which parent objects it should be passed.

      # This returns the path for the given object,

      # For example, in HatsController where Person has_many :hats,
      # the following are equivalent:
      #
      #   object_path             #=> "/people/42/hats/12"

      # but it can be overridden if another prefix is needed.
      # Note that if this is overridden,
      # the new method should return a string ending in an underscore.
      #
      # For example, in Admin::Content::PagesController:
      #
      #   url_helper_prefix #=> "admin_content_"
      #
      # Then +object_path+ is the same as <tt>admin_content_page_path(current_object)</tt>.
