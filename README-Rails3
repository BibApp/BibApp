This file is here to temporarily keep track of what needs to be done for
Rails 3 migration.

- There are numerous deprecations that will need to be fixed, but 
this doesn't seem urgent.
- Things that use RJS (e.g. link_to_remote) will need to be checked.
Some things may continue to work with small modifications (e.g. I think
remote forms will), but some may need to be redone entirely. Just need
to locate and evaluate on a case by case basis, I guess.

There are doubtless more issues, but this is what I've run into so far.
