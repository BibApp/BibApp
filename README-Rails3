This file is here to temporarily keep track of what needs to be done for
Rails 3 migration.

- The authorization plugin seems to be causing problems, even though
I used a fork that was supposed to be Rails 3 compatible. Most of the
remaining spec failures seem to occur here.
- There are numerous deprecations that will need to be fixed, but 
this doesn't seem urgent.
- The server will start, but try to do anything and there is a 
mysterious error that doesn't seem to relate to the application code
at all. I want to fix the authorization stuff before trying to look
into this too deeply (on the outside chance that it is related).

There are doubtless more issues, but this is what I've run into so far.
