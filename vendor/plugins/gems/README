Gems
====

This is a small plugin that helps with Ruby Gem management for your application.  
It will automatically include all gem/lib paths into the $LOAD_PATH on startup.

To freeze gems:

  $ rake gems:freeze GEM=tzinfo
  (in /path/to/app)
  rm -rf vendor/tzinfo-0.1.2
  cd /path/to/app/config/../vendor
  mkdir -p tzinfo-0.1.2
  Unpacked tzinfo 0.1.2 to 'tzinfo-0.1.2'
  cd -

Be sure to require them in your environment.rb if you want them available.

  $ script/console
  Loading development environment.
  >> TZInfo
  NameError: uninitialized constant TZInfo
  >> require 'Tzinfo'
  => true
  >> TZInfo
  => TZInfo

You can also freeze specific versions:

  rake gems:freeze GEM=tzinfo VERSION=0.1.2
