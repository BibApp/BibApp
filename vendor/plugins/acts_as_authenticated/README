acts_as_authenticated generator
====

This is a basic authentication generator for rails, very much in the spirit of xal's original Login Generator.

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user account

This generates a basic user model, a controller, some basic views, and tests.  Extra functionality can be unlocked by
removing the comments for them.  I have a few examples such as user activation and reversible encrypted passwords.

Two more generators are provided...

Generate your mailer:

  ./script/generate authenticated_mailer user

Generate a new migration for the user model:

  ./script/generate authenticated_migration add_authenticated_table
