== Instructions

* For edge Rails r7315 or above use http://svn.viney.net.nz/things/branches/active_record_base_without_table

Get the power of ActiveRecord models, including validation, without having a table in the database.

  class Contact < ActiveRecord::BaseWithoutTable
    column :name, :string
    column :email_address, :string
    column :message, :text
    
    validates_presence_of :name, :email_address, :string
  end
  
This model can be used just like a regular model based on a table, except it will never be saved to the database.

There is a good blog post available on the plugin:
