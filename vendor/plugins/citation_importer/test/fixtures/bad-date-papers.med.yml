      AB  - Objective-To determine the frequency and duration of feline panleukopenia
            virus (FPV) vaccine-induced interference with fecal parvovirus diagnostic
            testing in cats. Design-Prospective controlled study. Animals-Sixty-four
            8- to 10-week-old specific-pathogen-free kittens. Procedures-Kittens were
            inoculated once with 1 of 8 commercial multivalent vaccines containing
            modified-live virus (MLV) or inactivated FPV by the SC or intranasal
            routes. Feces were tested for parvovirus antigen immediately prior to
            vaccination, then daily for 14 days with 3 tests designed for detection of
            canine parvovirus. Serum anti-FPV antibody titers were determined by use
            of hemagglutination inhibition prior to vaccination and 14 days later.
            Results-All fecal parvovirus test results were negative prior to
            vaccination. After vaccination, 1 kitten had positive test results with
            test 1, 4 kittens had positive results with test 2, and 13 kittens had
            positive results with test 3. Only 1 kitten had positive results with all
            3 tests, and only 2 of those tests were subjectively considered to have
            strongly positive results. At 14 days after vaccination, 31% of kittens
            receiving inactivated vaccines had protective FPV titers, whereas 85% of
            kittens receiving MLV vaccines had protective titers. Conclusions and
            Clinical Relevance-Animal shelter veterinarians should select fecal tests
            for parvovirus detection that have high sensitivity for FPV and low
            frequency of vaccine-related test interference. Positive parvovirus test
            results should be interpreted in light of clinical signs, vaccination
            history, and results of confirmatory testing. Despite the possibility of
            test interference, the benefit provided by universal MLV FPV vaccination
            of cats in high-risk environments such as shelters outweighs the impact on
            diagnostic test accuracy.

      TI  - Ontogenesis of morphine-induced behavior in the cat.
      PG  - 53-61
      AB  - We analyzed the behavioral responses to a single dose of morphine in
            kittens at postnatal (P) ages 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Each kitten
            received 0.5 or 3.0 mg/kg i.p. of morphine sulphate or saline vehicle. An
            average of 6.5 kittens were studied at each dose and age. An ethogram was
            constructed, based on morphine effects in adult cats, to score appropriate
            behaviors from direct observation and video sampling. After injection
            behaviors were sampled for periods of 2 min every 15-30 min for a total of
            4 h. The frequency of each selected behavior was scored at 2 s intervals
            during each of the 2 min periods and it was expressed as a percent of all
            time samples scored for the 4 h period. Statistical comparisons were made
            with control (saline) littermates. At P7-15 the drug's main effect was
            behavioral depression; i.e., kittens, away from the litter, laid sprawled
            as if with no muscle tonus; Nursing was suppressed and Vocalization was
            distressed. Mainly with the higher dose, at P30, morphine-specific
            behaviors appeared for the first time. With the kitten in a Sitting
            position, these included stereotypical Head and Paw Movements and body
            Torsion. At P60 other drug-elicited behaviors emerged, including Spinning,
            Retching, and Vomiting. By P90-120 the frequency of Head (16.0%) and Paw
            (16.9%) Movements doubled relative to P30-60. Morphine significantly
            changed frequencies of newly matured behaviors (in control kittens)
            including Sniffing and Licking (increased), and Grooming
            (decreased/blocked). Retching and Vomiting increased to adult levels.
            Morphine-induced hyperthermia was first detected at P60 and peaked by
            P90-P120. The early behavioral depression shifted to a pattern of
            increasing activity starting at P30 and peaking at P90-120, at which time
            Sleep was absent and Laying was reduced, while Walking and Sitting were
            increased. We concluded that the maturation of the stereotypical
            behavioral responses to morphine in cats begins at about P30 and is
            completed between P90 and 120. Results are discussed in terms of
            developmental parameters and putative brain sites of morphine's actions.
