      Objective-To determine the frequency and duration of feline panleukopenia
            virus (FPV) vaccine-induced interference with fecal parvovirus diagnostic
            testing in cats. Design-Prospective controlled study. Animals-Sixty-four
            8- to 10-week-old specific-pathogen-free kittens. Procedures-Kittens were
            inoculated once with 1 of 8 commercial multivalent vaccines containing
            modified-live virus (MLV) or inactivated FPV by the SC or intranasal
            routes. Feces were tested for parvovirus antigen immediately prior to
            vaccination, then daily for 14 days with 3 tests designed for detection of
            canine parvovirus. Serum anti-FPV antibody titers were determined by use
            of hemagglutination inhibition prior to vaccination and 14 days later.
            Results-All fecal parvovirus test results were negative prior to
            vaccination. After vaccination, 1 kitten had positive test results with
            test 1, 4 kittens had positive results with test 2, and 13 kittens had
            positive results with test 3. Only 1 kitten had positive results with all
            3 tests, and only 2 of those tests were subjectively considered to have
            strongly positive results. At 14 days after vaccination, 31% of kittens
            receiving inactivated vaccines had protective FPV titers, whereas 85% of
            kittens receiving MLV vaccines had protective titers. Conclusions and
            Clinical Relevance-Animal shelter veterinarians should select fecal tests
            for parvovirus detection that have high sensitivity for FPV and low
            frequency of vaccine-related test interference. Positive parvovirus test
            results should be interpreted in light of clinical signs, vaccination
            history, and results of confirmatory testing. Despite the possibility of
            test interference, the benefit provided by universal MLV FPV vaccination
            of cats in high-risk environments such as shelters outweighs the impact on
            diagnostic test accuracy.

      We analyzed the behavioral responses to a single dose of morphine in
            kittens at postnatal (P) ages 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Each kitten
            received 0.5 or 3.0 mg/kg i.p. of morphine sulphate or saline vehicle. An
            average of 6.5 kittens were studied at each dose and age. An ethogram was
            constructed, based on morphine effects in adult cats, to score appropriate
            behaviors from direct observation and video sampling. After injection
            behaviors were sampled for periods of 2 min every 15-30 min for a total of
            4 h. The frequency of each selected behavior was scored at 2 s intervals
            during each of the 2 min periods and it was expressed as a percent of all
            time samples scored for the 4 h period. Statistical comparisons were made
            with control (saline) littermates. At P7-15 the drug's main effect was
            behavioral depression; i.e., kittens, away from the litter, laid sprawled
            as if with no muscle tonus; Nursing was suppressed and Vocalization was
            distressed. Mainly with the higher dose, at P30, morphine-specific
            behaviors appeared for the first time. With the kitten in a Sitting
            position, these included stereotypical Head and Paw Movements and body
            Torsion. At P60 other drug-elicited behaviors emerged, including Spinning,
            Retching, and Vomiting. By P90-120 the frequency of Head (16.0%) and Paw
            (16.9%) Movements doubled relative to P30-60. Morphine significantly
            changed frequencies of newly matured behaviors (in control kittens)
            including Sniffing and Licking (increased), and Grooming
            (decreased/blocked). Retching and Vomiting increased to adult levels.
            Morphine-induced hyperthermia was first detected at P60 and peaked by
            P90-P120. The early behavioral depression shifted to a pattern of
            increasing activity starting at P30 and peaking at P90-120, at which time
            Sleep was absent and Laying was reduced, while Walking and Sitting were
            increased. We concluded that the maturation of the stereotypical
            behavioral responses to morphine in cats begins at about P30 and is
            completed between P90 and 120. Results are discussed in terms of
            developmental parameters and putative brain sites of morphine's actions.

      Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a zoonotic illness caused by the Gram
            negative bacillus Bartonella henselae characterized by a small skin lesion
            at the site of a bite, lick or scratch by a cat, commonly followed by
            regional lymphadenopathy 1 or 2 weeks later. We report herein on severe
            neurological complications of CSD combining brainstem encephalopathy and
            basal ganglia impairment. This 12-year-old female acutely presented to a
            local hospital with profound coma and a prolonged tonic posturing of
            extremities. On the neurological examination she was deeply comatose with
            pin-point pupils and lack of vestibulo-ocular responses, suggestive of
            brainstem encephalopathy, along with marked rigid hypertonicity suggestive
            also of basal ganglia impairment. Initially suspecting Herpes simplex
            encephalitis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis she was promptly
            started with high-dose methyl-prednisolone and acyclovir. Her parents
            apparently reported that she was scratched by a kitten some 4 weeks prior
            to her present admission and as such, suspecting CSD, she was begun with
            doxycycline and rifampicin. Her serology had proven positive for IgM
            antibodies to Bartonella henselae establishing the diagnosis. She regained
            consciousness after 4 days and the signs of brainstem and extra-pyramidal
            impairment also gradually abated and disappeared after 10 days. A
            follow-up exam after a month disclosed mild extra-pyramidal abnormalities
            which disappeared after 3 months. Although extremely rare, CSD should be
            also considered in a patient presenting with a severe encephalopathy and
            associated basal ganglia impairment. The prompt administration of
            high-dose methyl-prednisolone upon admission may have contributed to the
            favorable outcome in our patient and therefore should be advocated in any
            patient presenting with profound encephalopathy regardless the underlying
            etiology recovered later.

            impairment also gradually abated and disappeared after 10 days. A
            follow-up exam after a month disclosed mild extra-pyramidal abnormalities
            which disappeared after 3 months. Although extremely rare, CSD should be
            also considered in a patient presenting with a severe encephalopathy and
            associated basal ganglia impairment. The prompt administration of
            high-dose methyl-prednisolone upon admission may have contributed to the
            favorable outcome in our patient and therefore should be advocated in any
            patient presenting with profound encephalopathy regardless the underlying
            etiology recovered later.

      As part of a species recovery program, 129 Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis)
            originating from British Columbia, the Yukon, Manitoba, and Quebec,
            Canada, and Alaska, USA, were reintroduced to southwestern Colorado, USA,
            from 1999 to 2003. Of 52 lynx mortalities documented by October 2003, six
            lynx, including a female and her 5-mo-old kitten, had evidence of Yersinia
            pestis infection as determined by fluorescent antibody test and/or
            culture. Postmortem findings in these lynx were characterized by
            pneumonia, ranging from acute suppurative pneumonia, to multifocal
            necrotizing pneumonia, to fibrinous bronchopneumonia. Histopathologic
            examination of lung revealed multiple areas of inflammation and
            consolidation, areas of edema and hemorrhage, and bacteria surrounded by
            extensive inflammation. Spleens had severe lymphoid depletion and
            hypocellular red pulp. Lymphadenomegaly was observed in only one
            plague-affected lynx. We hypothesize that these Canada lynx were exposed
            to Y. pestis by infected prey, and these are the first reports of plague
            in this species.

      A three-week-old Devon rex kitten and a four-week-old English bulldog
            puppy were presented with "swimmer syndrome". The owners consulted several
            veterinarians who suggested euthanasia as the only possible solution for
            this condition. Physiotherapy in the puppy, and physiotherapy and
            bandaging in the kitten led to the resolution of the clinical signs and
            resulted in normal ambulation after several weeks. The authors concluded
            that intensive physiotherapy and dedication of the owner can lead to
            success.

      OBJECTIVE: To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern
            Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported.
            DESIGN: Retrospective/prospective study. RESULTS: Nocardia spp infections
            were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of
            Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one
            isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats
            presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with
            draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of
            circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally
            by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in
            regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body
            wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions
            were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable,
            from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute
            fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three
            were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1
            entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or
            older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N
            nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all
            cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic
            corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following
            chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections
            [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured.
            Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several
            months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another
            was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite
            treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two
            cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to
            follow up. CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently
            it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be
            clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing
            mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised
            infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If
            definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends
            to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of
            therapy leads to disease recurrence.

            it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be
            clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing
            mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised
            infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If
            definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends
            to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of
            therapy leads to disease recurrence.

      A 2-month-old, female cat was presented for abdomen dilation. The patient
            was undernourished, and severe left hydronephrosis was diagnosed after
            clinical, ultrasonographical and radiographical examination. Although
            pyelography was performed in order to visualise the ureteral course,
            surgery was necessary to reach a final aetiological diagnosis and
            treatment. At gross examination, the left ureter crossed the renal capsula
            at the level of the caudal renal pole, and the subcapsular ureteral
            segment was markedly dilated. Distal to the renal capsula, the left ureter
            was very thin when compared to the right. The parenchyma of the left
            kidney, as suggested by ultrasonographical evaluation, was extremely
            reduced in thickness. An ureteronephrectomy was performed.
            Histopathological evaluation revealed glomerular sclerosis and diffuse
            parenchymal fibrosis. Severe hydronephrosis derived from an altered renal
            pelvic anatomy and abnormal ureteral course determining functional
            stenosis. Diagnosis of congenital anomaly before development of
            complications such as hydronephrosis could have allowed a surgical renal
            capsulectomy and obstruction relief. To the author's knowledge, this is
            the first report of severe hydronephrosis associated to altered renal
            pelvic anatomy and proximal ureteral ectopia in cat.

      The Monte Carlo N-particle code MCNP version 4C3 was used to investigate the
            backscattering and transmission of high-energy photons in concrete, iron and lead
            at deep penetration. A typical bremsstrahlung beam from a 24 MV linac was used,
            and the transmission up to 15 mean-free paths was studied. Broad beam slab
            geometry was used. Estimates of the transmission in terms of absorbed dose to
            tissue ratio and air kerma ratio were performed for the primary and secondary
            components of the transmitted beam in the three materials. The tissue dose and
            air kerma buildup factors were calculated and fitted to Berger's equation.
            Finally, the differential dose albedo values for common reflected angles were
            determined.
