TI  - Effect of vaccination on parvovirus antigen testing in kittens.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - Objective-To determine the frequency and duration of feline panleukopenia
      virus (FPV) vaccine-induced interference with fecal parvovirus diagnostic
      testing in cats. Design-Prospective controlled study. Animals-Sixty-four
      8- to 10-week-old specific-pathogen-free kittens. Procedures-Kittens were
      inoculated once with 1 of 8 commercial multivalent vaccines containing
      modified-live virus (MLV) or inactivated FPV by the SC or intranasal
      routes. Feces were tested for parvovirus antigen immediately prior to
      vaccination, then daily for 14 days with 3 tests designed for detection of
      canine parvovirus. Serum anti-FPV antibody titers were determined by use
      of hemagglutination inhibition prior to vaccination and 14 days later.
      Results-All fecal parvovirus test results were negative prior to
      vaccination. After vaccination, 1 kitten had positive test results with
      test 1, 4 kittens had positive results with test 2, and 13 kittens had
      positive results with test 3. Only 1 kitten had positive results with all
      3 tests, and only 2 of those tests were subjectively considered to have
      strongly positive results. At 14 days after vaccination, 31% of kittens
      receiving inactivated vaccines had protective FPV titers, whereas 85% of
      kittens receiving MLV vaccines had protective titers. Conclusions and
      Clinical Relevance-Animal shelter veterinarians should select fecal tests
      for parvovirus detection that have high sensitivity for FPV and low
      frequency of vaccine-related test interference. Positive parvovirus test
      results should be interpreted in light of clinical signs, vaccination
      history, and results of confirmatory testing. Despite the possibility of
      test interference, the benefit provided by universal MLV FPV vaccination
      of cats in high-risk environments such as shelters outweighs the impact on
      diagnostic test accuracy.

TI  - Ontogenesis of morphine-induced behavior in the cat.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - We analyzed the behavioral responses to a single dose of morphine in
      kittens at postnatal (P) ages 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Each kitten
      received 0.5 or 3.0 mg/kg i.p. of morphine sulphate or saline vehicle. An
      average of 6.5 kittens were studied at each dose and age. An ethogram was
      constructed, based on morphine effects in adult cats, to score appropriate
      behaviors from direct observation and video sampling. After injection
      behaviors were sampled for periods of 2 min every 15-30 min for a total of
      4 h. The frequency of each selected behavior was scored at 2 s intervals
      during each of the 2 min periods and it was expressed as a percent of all
      time samples scored for the 4 h period. Statistical comparisons were made
      with control (saline) littermates. At P7-15 the drug's main effect was
      behavioral depression; i.e., kittens, away from the litter, laid sprawled
      as if with no muscle tonus; Nursing was suppressed and Vocalization was
      distressed. Mainly with the higher dose, at P30, morphine-specific
      behaviors appeared for the first time. With the kitten in a Sitting
      position, these included stereotypical Head and Paw Movements and body
      Torsion. At P60 other drug-elicited behaviors emerged, including Spinning,
      Retching, and Vomiting. By P90-120 the frequency of Head (16.0%) and Paw
      (16.9%) Movements doubled relative to P30-60. Morphine significantly
      changed frequencies of newly matured behaviors (in control kittens)
      including Sniffing and Licking (increased), and Grooming
      (decreased/blocked). Retching and Vomiting increased to adult levels.
      Morphine-induced hyperthermia was first detected at P60 and peaked by
      P90-P120. The early behavioral depression shifted to a pattern of
      increasing activity starting at P30 and peaking at P90-120, at which time
      Sleep was absent and Laying was reduced, while Walking and Sitting were
      increased. We concluded that the maturation of the stereotypical
      behavioral responses to morphine in cats begins at about P30 and is
      completed between P90 and 120. Results are discussed in terms of
      developmental parameters and putative brain sites of morphine's actions.

TI  - Effect of high-dose methyl-prednisolone on brainstem encephalopathy and
      basal ganglia impairment complicating cat scratch disease.
AB  - Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a zoonotic illness caused by the Gram
      negative bacillus Bartonella henselae characterized by a small skin lesion
      at the site of a bite, lick or scratch by a cat, commonly followed by
      regional lymphadenopathy 1 or 2 weeks later. We report herein on severe
      neurological complications of CSD combining brainstem encephalopathy and
      basal ganglia impairment. This 12-year-old female acutely presented to a
      local hospital with profound coma and a prolonged tonic posturing of
      extremities. On the neurological examination she was deeply comatose with
      pin-point pupils and lack of vestibulo-ocular responses, suggestive of
      brainstem encephalopathy, along with marked rigid hypertonicity suggestive
      also of basal ganglia impairment. Initially suspecting Herpes simplex
      encephalitis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis she was promptly
      started with high-dose methyl-prednisolone and acyclovir. Her parents
      apparently reported that she was scratched by a kitten some 4 weeks prior
      to her present admission and as such, suspecting CSD, she was begun with
      doxycycline and rifampicin. Her serology had proven positive for IgM
      antibodies to Bartonella henselae establishing the diagnosis. She regained
      consciousness after 4 days and the signs of brainstem and extra-pyramidal
      impairment also gradually abated and disappeared after 10 days. A
      follow-up exam after a month disclosed mild extra-pyramidal abnormalities
      which disappeared after 3 months. Although extremely rare, CSD should be
      also considered in a patient presenting with a severe encephalopathy and
      associated basal ganglia impairment. The prompt administration of
      high-dose methyl-prednisolone upon admission may have contributed to the
      favorable outcome in our patient and therefore should be advocated in any
      patient presenting with profound encephalopathy regardless the underlying
      etiology recovered later.

TI  - Plague as a mortality factor in Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) reintroduced
      to Colorado.
PG  - 646-50
AB  - As part of a species recovery program, 129 Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis)
      originating from British Columbia, the Yukon, Manitoba, and Quebec,
      Canada, and Alaska, USA, were reintroduced to southwestern Colorado, USA,
      from 1999 to 2003. Of 52 lynx mortalities documented by October 2003, six
      lynx, including a female and her 5-mo-old kitten, had evidence of Yersinia
      pestis infection as determined by fluorescent antibody test and/or
      culture. Postmortem findings in these lynx were characterized by
      pneumonia, ranging from acute suppurative pneumonia, to multifocal
      necrotizing pneumonia, to fibrinous bronchopneumonia. Histopathologic
      examination of lung revealed multiple areas of inflammation and
      consolidation, areas of edema and hemorrhage, and bacteria surrounded by
      extensive inflammation. Spleens had severe lymphoid depletion and
      hypocellular red pulp. Lymphadenomegaly was observed in only one
      plague-affected lynx. We hypothesize that these Canada lynx were exposed
      to Y. pestis by infected prey, and these are the first reports of plague
      in this species.

TI  - Swimmer syndrome in a Devon rex kitten and an English bulldog puppy.
PG  - 615-9
AB  - A three-week-old Devon rex kitten and a four-week-old English bulldog
      puppy were presented with "swimmer syndrome". The owners consulted several
      veterinarians who suggested euthanasia as the only possible solution for
      this condition. Physiotherapy in the puppy, and physiotherapy and
      bandaging in the kitten led to the resolution of the clinical signs and
      resulted in normal ambulation after several weeks. The authors concluded
      that intensive physiotherapy and dedication of the owner can lead to
      success.

TI  - Nocardia infections in cats: a retrospective multi-institutional study of
      17 cases.
PG  - 235-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern
      Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported.
      DESIGN: Retrospective/prospective study. RESULTS: Nocardia spp infections
      were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of
      Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one
      isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats
      presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with
      draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of
      circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally
      by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in
      regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body
      wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions
      were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable,
      from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute
      fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three
      were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1
      entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or
      older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N
      nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all
      cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic
      corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following
      chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections
      [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured.
      Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several
      months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another
      was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite
      treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two
      cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to
      follow up. CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently
      it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be
      clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing
      mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised
      infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If
      definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends
      to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of
      therapy leads to disease recurrence.

TI  - Proximal ureteral ectopia causing hydronephrosis in a kitten.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - A 2-month-old, female cat was presented for abdomen dilation. The patient
      was undernourished, and severe left hydronephrosis was diagnosed after
      clinical, ultrasonographical and radiographical examination. Although
      pyelography was performed in order to visualise the ureteral course,
      surgery was necessary to reach a final aetiological diagnosis and
      treatment. At gross examination, the left ureter crossed the renal capsula
      at the level of the caudal renal pole, and the subcapsular ureteral
      segment was markedly dilated. Distal to the renal capsula, the left ureter
      was very thin when compared to the right. The parenchyma of the left
      kidney, as suggested by ultrasonographical evaluation, was extremely
      reduced in thickness. An ureteronephrectomy was performed.
      Histopathological evaluation revealed glomerular sclerosis and diffuse
      parenchymal fibrosis. Severe hydronephrosis derived from an altered renal
      pelvic anatomy and abnormal ureteral course determining functional
      stenosis. Diagnosis of congenital anomaly before development of
      complications such as hydronephrosis could have allowed a surgical renal
      capsulectomy and obstruction relief. To the author's knowledge, this is
      the first report of severe hydronephrosis associated to altered renal
      pelvic anatomy and proximal ureteral ectopia in cat.

PG  - 547-52
AB  - The Monte Carlo N-particle code MCNP version 4C3 was used to investigate the
      backscattering and transmission of high-energy photons in concrete, iron and lead
      at deep penetration. A typical bremsstrahlung beam from a 24 MV linac was used,
      and the transmission up to 15 mean-free paths was studied. Broad beam slab
      geometry was used. Estimates of the transmission in terms of absorbed dose to
      tissue ratio and air kerma ratio were performed for the primary and secondary
      components of the transmitted beam in the three materials. The tissue dose and
      air kerma buildup factors were calculated and fitted to Berger's equation.
      Finally, the differential dose albedo values for common reflected angles were
      determined.
