CitationParser
==============

Parses supported citation formats "as-is" into a Ruby Hash.

During the parsing the following occurs:
(1) Field names are underscored
    (e.g. "FirstAuthor" -> "first_author" or "Author" -> "author")
(2) Resulting names are turned into symbols 
    (e.g. "first_author" -> :first_author)
However, the data values within fields are not changed in any way.

In addition, a special :original_data field is added to the
resulting Hash.  Its value corresponds to the text of
the entire original citation (in its original structure).

So, for RIS citations, this :original_data field will contain
the entire citation in RIS format.  

For MedLine citations, the :original_data
field contains the entire citation in MedLine format.  

You get the idea. :)

An RIS example: 
================
Parsing of the below RIS citation:
 TY  - THES
 ID  - 1031
 A1  - Gill,Pat
 T1  - A trick done with mirrors : women and morality in Restoration satiric comedy
 Y1  - 1987
 KW  - English drama
 KW  - Restoration drama
 VL  - Ph. D.
 PB  - Cornell University
 A3  - Anonymous
 M1  - Dissertation/Thesis
 ER  - 

Produces a Ruby Hash of the structure:
{
 :ty => "THES",
 :id => "1031",
 :a1 => "Gill,Pat",
 :t1 => "A trick done with mirrors : women and morality in Restoration satiric comedy",
 :y1 => "1987",
 :kw => "English drama",
 :kw => "Restoration drama",
 :vl => "Ph. D.",
 :pb => "Cornell University",
 :a3 => "Anonymous",
 :m1 => "Dissertation/Thesis",
 :er => "",
 :original_data  => "<<entire original citation in RIS appears here>>"
}
