CitationParser Plugin
=====================

Gem Requirements:
------------------
  * HTMLEntities - required for XML-based parsers


Details:
--------
Parses supported citation formats "as-is" into a Ruby Hash.

During the parsing the following occurs:
  (1) Field names are underscored (and lowercased)
      (e.g. "FirstAuthor" -> "first_author" or "Author" -> "author")
  (2) Resulting names are turned into Ruby symbols
      (e.g. "first_author" -> :first_author)
  (3) Null or empty values are not added to final Hash
  (4) Values are all converted to Arrays of values
      (to better handle mult-value fields)
      (e.g. "2005" -> ["2005"])

However, the actual values within fields are not changed or validated
in any way.

In addition, a special :original_data field is added to the
resulting Hash.  Its value corresponds to the text of
the entire original citation (in its original structure).

  * So, for RIS citations, this :original_data field will contain
    the entire citation in RIS format.

  * For MedLine citations, the :original_data
    field contains the entire citation in MedLine format.

You get the idea. :)


An RIS example:
----------------
Parsing of the below RIS citation:
 TY  - THES
 ID  - 1031
 A1  - Gill, Pat
 T1  - A trick done with mirrors : women and morality in Restoration satiric comedy
 Y1  - 1987
 KW  - English drama
 KW  - Restoration drama
 VL  - Ph. D.
 PB  - Cornell University
 A3  - Anonymous
 M1  - Dissertation/Thesis
 ER  -

Produces a Ruby Hash of the structure:
{
 :ty => ["THES"],
 :id => ["1031"],
 :a1 => ["Gill, Pat"],
 :t1 => ["A trick done with mirrors : women and morality in Restoration satiric comedy"],
 :y1 => ["1987"],
 :kw => ["English drama", "Restoration drama"],
 :vl => ["Ph. D."],
 :pb => ["Cornell University"],
 :a3 => ["Anonymous"],
 :m1 => ["Dissertation/Thesis"],
 :original_data  => "<<entire original citation in RIS format appears here>>"
}

The above Ruby Hash can then be used as a valid input to the 'citation_importer' plugin.


Testing:
---------

If you would like to see more sample outputs of this CitationParser plugin,
there is a rake task to do so.  From your Rails Application ([rails-app])
root directory run:

rake citation_parser:test_dump

This will run through all Test Fixtures (in [citation_parser]/test/fixtures/)
and write the output to YAML files in your [rails-app]/tmp/ directory
(with the extension ".yml" appended).
