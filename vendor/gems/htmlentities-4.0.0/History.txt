== 4.0.0 (2007-03-15)
* New instantiation-based interface (but legacy interface is preserved for
  compatibility.
* Handles HTML4 as well as XHTML1 (the former lacks the &apos; entity).
* Encodes basic entities numerically when :basic isn't specified and :decimal
  or :hexadecimal is.
* Performs a maximum of two gsub passes instead of three when encoding, which
  should be more efficient on long strings.

== 3.1.0 (2007-01-19)
* Now understands all the entities referred to in the XHTML 1.0 DTD (253 
  entities compared with 131 in version 3.0.1).
* Calls to_s on parameters to play nicely with Rails 1.2.1.
* Entity mapping data is now lazily loaded.

== 3.0.1 (2005-04-08)
* Improved documentation.

== 3.0.0 (2005-04-08)
* Changed licence to MIT due to confusion with previous 'Fair' licence (my
  intention was to be liberal, not obscure).
* Moved basic functionality out of String class; for previous behaviour,
  require 'htmlentities/string'.
* Changed version numbering scheme.
* Now available as a Gem.

== 2.2 (2005-11-07)
* Important bug fixes -- thanks to Moonwolf.
* Decoding hexadecimal entities now accepts 'f' as a hex digit. (D'oh!)
* Decimal decoding edge cases addressed.
* Test cases added.

== 2.1 (2005-10-31)
* Removed some unnecessary code in basic entity encoding.
* Improved handling of encoding: commands are now automatically sorted, so the
  user doesn't have to worry about their order.
* Now using setup.rb.
* Tests moved to separate file.

* Decoding interface unchanged.
