Welcome to Blueprint! This is a CSS framework designed to 
cut down on your CSS development time. It gives you a solid 
foundation to build your own CSS on. Here are some of the 
features BP provides out-of-the-box:

* An easily customizable grid
* Sensible default typography
* A typographic baseline
* Perfected browser CSS reset
* A stylesheet for printing
* Powerful scripts for customization
* Absolutely no bloat!


Setup instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here's how you set up Blueprint on your site. 

1) Upload the "blueprint" folder in this folder to your server, 
   and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice 
   would be your CSS folder.

2) Add the following three lines to every <head> section of your
   site. Make sure the three href paths are correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder):

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/print.css" type="text/css" media="print"> 
   <!--[if IE]><link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/ie.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection"><![endif]-->
	
	 Remember to include trailing slashes (" />") in these lines if you're using XHTML.

3) For development, add the .showgrid class to any container or column
   to see the underlying grid. Check out the 'plugins' directory for
   more advanced functionality.

Files in Blueprint
----------------------------------------------------------------

The framework has a few files you should check out. Every file
in the 'src' directory contains lots of (hopefully) clarifying 
comments.

Compressed files (these go in the HTML):

* blueprint/screen.css
* blueprint/print.css
* blueprint/ie.css

Source files:

* blueprint/src/reset.css
  This file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.

* blueprint/src/grid.css
  This file sets up the grid (it's true). It has a lot of classes
  you apply to divs to set up any sort of column-based grid.

* blueprint/src/typography.css
  This file sets some default typography. It also has a few
  methods for some really fancy stuff to do with your text.

* blueprint/src/forms.css
  Includes some minimal styling of forms.

* blueprint/src/print.css
  This file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions
  of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be 
  included on every page.

* blueprint/src/ie.css
  Includes every hack for our beloved IE6 and 7.

Scripts:

* lib/compress.rb
  A Ruby script for compressing and customizing your CSS. Set a
  custom namespace, column count, widths, output paths, multiple 
  projects, and semantic class names. See commenting in compress.rb 
  or run $ruby compress.rb -h for more information.

* lib/validate.rb
  Validates the Blueprint core files with the W3C CSS validator.

Other:

* blueprint/plugins/
  Contains additional functionality in the form of simple plugins
  for Blueprint. See individual readme files in the directory
  of each plugin for further instructions.

* tests/
  Contains html files which tests most aspects of Blueprint.
  Open tests/index.html for further instructions.
