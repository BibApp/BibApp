  abstract: One important assumption in a model of an electricity market is the format of bids and costs. Most literature on electricity markets uses piecewise linear or quadratic functions to represent costs and bids. Economic theory holds that a firm in a perfectly competitive market maximizes its profit when it sells at marginal cost. This implies that profit-maximizing generators will bid at marginal cost. Different markets have varying rules regarding bid formats. Piecewise linear bid curves are compatible with physical characteristics of electricity generators, but cause difficulties in certain analysis techniques. Quadratic bid curves provide smooth dispatch, revenue, and profit curves that facilitate calculus-based analysis. In profit calculations, bids and marginal costs may either be coupled or independent of each other. The relation between bids and marginal costs impacts the profit-maximizing bid, and thus impacts generator strategies. These assumptions are particularly important for marginal generators, since different bid structures may yield different dispatch results, especially if the system is constrained. We compare markets with all piecewise linear bids, all quadratic bids, and a mixture of bids, and study the impacts of bid format and profit calculation on market outcomes in different scenarios.

  abstract: In bulk electric power transfer capability computations, the transmission reliability margin accounts for uncertainties related to the transmission system conditions, contingencies, and parameter values. We propose a formula which quantifies transmission reliability margin based on transfer capability sensitivities and a probabilistic characterization of the various uncertainties. The formula is verified by comparison with results from two systems small enough to permit accurate Monte Carlo simulations. The formula contributes to more accurate and defensible transfer capability calculations. &copy; 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: The power system and the real-time market operation are closely coupled with the future market positions taken by market participants. Assessing the stability of the real-time market is critical because an unstable market will be characterized not only by fluctuating prices that do not settle to constant values, but more worrisome, it could create the possibility of inducing slow electromechanical oscillations if left unchecked. We study the relation between the real-time market, potential market power exercise and the stability of equilibrium. We conclude that the role of futures markets on the real time market is closely related with market power mitigation and risk hedging. The stability of the clearing prices and generator output is not directly tied to future market positions taken by market participants. We finally conclude that market power potential has a significant impact on the stability of the market, raising a new tradeoff between market efficiency and market dynamics.

  abstract: "Market power in any market can result in higher prices than in a truly competitive market. Electricity markets pose unique problems to detection of market power due to the properties of electricity: it cannot be stored, which implies that the amount of energy supplied must always equal the amount demanded, and it must obey the laws of physics. A group of generators may exercise market power through tacit collusion, all raising prices together without communicating their intentions. Generators will use their expectations of market conditions to choose a competitive (low) bid, or a non-competitive (high) bid. We use expected residual demand to describe market conditions, and calculate threshold levels where a generator would decide to change from low to high bid. We examine the effects of uncertainty in load and competitor behavior on collusion decisions in both uniform price and discriminatory price auctions."
