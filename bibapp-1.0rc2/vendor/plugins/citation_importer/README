BibApp CitationImporter plugin
==============================


Plugin Requirements:
--------------------
  * 'CitationParser' plugin - The Ruby Hash output of this plugin is expected
    as an input to this one.


Details:
--------
Transforms a format-specific Ruby Hash (as returned from the 'citation_parser' 
plugin) into a Work attribute hash valid for import into BibApp:
http://bibapp.googlecode.com/

During the transformation the following occurs:
  (1) Field values are translated into valid BibApp Work attribute values:
      (e.g. A citation 'type' in the original Ruby Hash is translated
            into a valid BibApp Work 'type')
  (2) Date fields are parsed into valid Ruby Dates.  This includes adding
      a default month (January) and day (1) if necessary.
      (e.g. "2005" => "2005-01-01")
  (3) Fields that are not used by BibApp are dropped


An RIS Hash example:
--------------------
Parsing of the below RIS Ruby Hash:
{
 :ty => ["THES"],
 :id => ["1031"],
 :a1 => ["Gill, Pat"],
 :t1 => ["A trick done with mirrors : women and morality in Restoration satiric comedy"],
 :y1 => ["1987"],
 :kw => ["English drama", "Restoration drama"],
 :vl => ["Ph. D."],
 :pb => ["Cornell University"],
 :a3 => ["Anonymous"],
 :m1 => ["Dissertation/Thesis"],
 :original_data  => "<<entire original citation in RIS format appears here>>"
}

Produces a BibApp Work Attribute Hash of the following structure:
(see the 'citation_importers/ris_importer.rb' to find how the
 field mapping and value translation occurs)
{
 :klass             => "DissertationThesis",  #The BibApp class for Theses & Dissertations
 :work_name_strings => {:name => "Gill, Pat", :type=> "Author"},
 :title_primary     => "A trick done with mirrors : women and morality in Restoration satiric comedy",
 :publication_date  => "1987-01-01",
 :keywords          => ["English drama", "Restoration drama"],
 :volume            => "Ph. D.",
 :publisher         => "Cornell University",
 :notes             => "Dissertation/Thesis",
 :original_data     => "<<entire original citation in RIS format appears here>>"
}

Other formats (besides RIS) will produce a similar BibApp Work Attribute Hash, 
essentially mapping those formats into a Hash format which is understood by the 
BibApp system.

                       (e.g. [{:name => "Jones, John", :type=> "Author"},
                              {:name => "Smith, Sam", :type=> "Editor"}]),

 :notes             => <<Any notes attached to work>>,
 :links             => <<Any web addresses associated with the work>>,
 :publication_date  => <<Publication date in format: YYYY-MM-DD>>,
 :language          => <<Language of the work>>,
 :copyright_holder  => <<Name of the copyright holder (if known) for this work>>,
 :keywords          => <<Array of keywords>>,
 :issn_isbn         => <<ISSN or ISBN of the work, or its parent publication>>,
 :publication       => <<Name of Publication in which work appears>>
                       (e.g. may be a Journal Title, Book Title, etc.),
 :publication_place => <<Location of Publication>>, #NOT CURRENTLY USED
 :publisher         => <<Name of Publisher of the work>>,
 :source            => <<Name of Source of this citation>>, #NOT CURRENTLY USED
 :external_id       => <<Unique ID of this work in an external application>>, #NOT CURRENTLY USED
 :original_data     => <<entire original citation in its original format>>
}


Testing:
--------

If you would like to see more sample outputs of this CitationImporter plugin,
there is a rake task to do so.  From your Rails Application ([rails-app])
root directory run:

rake citation_importer:test_dump

This will run through all Test Fixtures (in [citation_importer]/test/fixtures/)
and write the output to YAML files in your [rails-app]/tmp/ directory
(with the extension ".bibapp.yml" appended).
