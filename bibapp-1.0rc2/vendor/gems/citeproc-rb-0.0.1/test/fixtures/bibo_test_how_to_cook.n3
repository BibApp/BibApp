    dcterms:description  "<P><B>A fully revised and updated edition of Raymond
Sokolov's classic kitchen primer for beginning chefs of all ages,
filled with 150 simple, sophisticated recipes, easy-to-learn
techniques, and indispensable advice. </B></P> <P>First published in
1986, Ray Sokolov's <I>How To Cook</I> is the ultimate book for
beginning cooks of all ages. Unlike most kitchen primers, How To Cook
does not assume any prior cooking instruction or skills, but rather
guides the reader through the entire cooking process with simple
explanations in ordinary language. There are no fancy cooking terms or
special gadget here, just easy, indispensable techniques and foolproof
recipes for every occasion. In this revised paperback edition, Sokolov
addresses the increased sophistication of even adamant non-cooks in
today's food-obsessed climate, while he sticks to the unfussy,
straightforward approach that made the original such a hit. Home cooks
will learn everything they need for years worth of fabulous meals,
from how to decipher recipe measurements, to how to fry an egg, to how
to steam a lobster. Even readers weaned on frozen pizza will find
recipes they can master, for last minute meals, special occasions and
entertaining, and even holidays-all made from scratch with fresh,
accessible ingredients. Experienced cooks will appreciate the simple
elegance of such flavorful dishes as Veal Scallopini or Pears Poached
in Red Wine. Written with Sokolov's trademark wit and wisdom, <I>How
To Cook</I> is an invaluable kitchen classic you'll turn to again and
again.</P>".
