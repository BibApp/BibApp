* Undeprecated Net::LDAP#modify. Thanks to Justin Forder for
  providing the rationale for this.
* Added a much-expanded set of special characters to the parser
  for RFC-2254 filters. Thanks to Andre Nathan.
* Changed Net::LDAP#search so you can pass it a filter in string form.
  The conversion to a Net::LDAP::Filter now happens automatically.
* Implemented Net::LDAP#bind_as (preliminary and subject to change).
  Thanks for Simon Claret for valuable suggestions and for helping test.
* Fixed bug in Net::LDAP#open that was preventing #open from being
  called more than one on a given Net::LDAP object.

  Thanks to Garett Shulman for suggestions and for helping test.

  suggestions.
* Added support for LE and GE search filters.

  by the introduction of RFC-2696 controls. Thanks to Andre
  Nathan for reporting the problem.
* Added support for RFC-2254 filter syntax.

== Net::LDAP 0.0.1: May 1, 2006
* Initial release.
* Client functionality is near-complete, although the APIs
  are not guaranteed and may change depending on feedback
  from the community.
* We're internally working on a Ruby-based implementation
  of a full-featured, production-quality LDAP server,
  which will leverage the underlying LDAP and BER functionality
  in Net::LDAP.
* Please tell us if you would be interested in seeing a public
  release of the LDAP server.
* Grateful acknowledgement to Austin Ziegler, who reviewed
  this code and provided the release framework, including
  minitar.
