# Config file for local LDAP settings.
# Your local LDAP can be used to pre-populate information
# about a Person in BibApp.  This means you won't have to 
# type in all their information by hand!
#
# Required settings:
#   'host' => Host of local LDAP server
#   'port'  => Port of local LDAP server (usually port 389)
#   'base' => Base Distinguished Name (Base DN) which BibApp 
#             will search for people matching a particular name.
#             This is usually similar to "dc=myu,dc=edu" for universities.
