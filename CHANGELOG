View refactoring - internal layouts, relocation of logic to helpers, more use of partials, etc.

1.1.0 - July 29, 2011
--------------
-THERE ARE SOME NEW MIGRATIONS - don't forget to migrate your database
-Abstract LDAP pieces into their own module
-Fix some importing problems
-Some fixes around authentication and log in procedure, etc.
-Remove most inline styles and use CSS instead
-General cleanup of view code
-Remove most inline javascript - move to separate files and include as needed
-Introduce jQuery for javascript (note - some old Prototype stuff is still
there)
-Redid some views that were doing some tricky stuff to get the same form to do
more than one thing.
-By default prevent bots from hitting search urls.
-Add omniauth capabilities - there is sample code for openID and OAuth. At
UIUC we do shibboleth (uiuc-connections branch) and I have simple start
(working) for LDAP (omniauth-ldap branch). Should make it very easy to
customize for various remote authentications.
-Load CSL files locally instead of over the web
-Display Sherpa data in more places
-Set up for cucumber (awaiting dependancy conflict with omniauth before
turning on in the Gemfile
-Set up for newrelic profiling (instructions of a sort in Gemfile)
-Set up for metrical (stand alone metric_fu - having metric_fu as part
of the project causes class collision) code analysis
-Much code refactoring and cleanup
-More tests
-Many minor bugfixes

1.1.0-rc3 - April 13, 2011
--------------
Many minor bugfixes
Merged some of jstirnaman's changes
Fixed import bug (caused by overaggressive uniqueness introduced in refactoring)
Remove all usage of login (or username) in favor of email
Index email field in database
Make change of email go through a confirmation process

1.1.0-rc2 - March 11, 2011
--------------
Fixed typo preventing 1.1.0-rc1 fropm working
Made sherpa directory shared for capistrano deployments

1.1.0-rc1 - March 11, 2011
--------------
Runs on Rails 3 (3.0.4 specifically) instead of Rails 2 (works with Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7)
Use Bundler for gem management
Many gems and plugins upgraded (primarily for Rails 3 compatibility)
Some gems added (e.g. for testing)
Rails and many plugins unvendored and now handled as gems
Testing moved to Rspec
Many tests added - some trivial, some not
A lot of code cleanup. Refactoring of code to more idiomatic ruby/rails, removal of stale/trivial comments, breakup of large methods, removal of magic numbers etc. The usual sorts of stuff.
Issue 148 fixed - person can now be both author and editor, for example
Migrations returned to db/migrate from db/archive
Capistrano gem included in the bundle and a deploy.rb.template file included for those wishing to use cap to deploy
Some minor bugfixes
A lot of deprecation fixes
A lot of observers removed and their work done in model callbacks. Rails 3 does model callbacks prior to observer callbacks, so the workaround for Rails 2 is no longer needed.
Moved Index.rb from app/models to lib as it seems to fit better there, although this could be reversed at some point, as there seem to be arguments either way.
Authentication now uses Authlogic (in compatibility mode for restful_authentication). This should provide a smoother experience as we attempt to add other kinds of authentication as well.
Added Eric Muzzy batch csv person import.
Added Jason Stirnaman person is active patch (plus some extra changes to help migrate existing installations to use it).
Added prototype_legacy_helper plugin to avoid having to deal with Rails 3 javascript conventions right away.
Changed routes both to conform to Rails 3 conventions and to remove default routes. All needed routes should henceforth be explicitly specified.
Use destroy instead of delete in association :dependent definitions. I couldn't find any compelling reason for delete, and lacking such destroy is better as it will run callbacks on the destroyed models.
Add additional submit button to publisher/publication editing so that user can return directly to alphabetical list.
Add view to show and facilitate deletion of orphaned works (i.e. no contributorships) by editor on Work.
Removed attachment_fu_hacks plugin. Hopefully the newer attachment_fu fixes the problems here.
Updated code for newer version of acts_as_state_machine - some callbacks needed to be changed here.

--------------

- Restricts access of regular users
Fixes IE error on new Person page
Fixes LDAP error
