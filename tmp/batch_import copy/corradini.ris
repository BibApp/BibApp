N2  - Experiments were conducted in a rectangular supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO<sub>2</sub>) natural-circulation loop at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in order to verify the stability margin as suggested by some previous investigators. Although a one-dimensional transient computational model developed at University of Wisconsin, Madison, predicted the development of instabilities for the SCCO<sub>2</sub> loop, which had good agreement with some previous work, the experiments conducted at the ANL SCCO<sub>2</sub> loop exhibited stable behavior under similar conditions. In order to bridge the gap between the numerical predictions and experimental results by distinguishing between the numerical effects and physical effects, a linear stability approach is adopted in the present study. The linear stability analysis has been conducted for three model natural-circulation loop geometries employing water or carbon dioxide as the working fluid. The results for the supercritical water loops displayed flow stability for a more accurate equation of state (EOS); however, the analysis indicated the presence of instabilities for a less accurate EOS. Furthermore, this analysis still predicts the presence of instabilities for the SCCO<sub>2</sub> loop similar to our transient numerical predictions. We additionally note that the stability margin for both water loops and the SCCO<sub>2</sub> loop does not correspond with proposed stability criteria from a previous analysis. These two final points suggest the phenomenon is a more complex function of both fluid properties and loop geometry

N2  - The behavior of supercritical (SC) fluid during a blowdown is under investigation. A model based on a steady state homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) and conditions with and without friction is presented. Calculations indicating three different possible regimes in a blowdown scenario are calculated with this model. The single-phase flow in the supercritical region and the transition either into subcooled water, a two-phase fluid or a superheated gas near the critical point results in an interesting flow with a wide range of behavior. Depending on the initial conditions and the geometry either vaporization or condensation can occur either in the pipe or at the exit. In addition, these results are to be extended to other fluids like CO<sub>2</sub>, R22 or R134a by comparing thermodynamic properties and their dynamic evolution to dimensionless SC water results. Finally the design of an experiment with initial data on the depressurization of a supercritical water system is presented

N2  - The ex-vessel strategy presumes a failure of the reactor pressure vessel. To achieve coolability, water needs to be present in the reactor cavity as a heat transfer medium to the ultimate heat sink. The controlled interaction and mixing of high-temperature melt and water is the important technical issue in the safety assessment of water-cooled reactors to achieve core coolability. Results of the heat transfer behavior and the stabilizing effect of noncondensable gas addition and system pressure is presented. Tests show that increasing noncondensable gas flow rate and increasing system pressure tend to stabilize the flow without a significant decrease in heat transfer for low water flow rates. The effect of gas injection and increased system pressure is negligible

N2  - The Supercritical Water (SCW) cooled nuclear reactor is one of the novel reactor design concepts under consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy. An SCW-cooled reactor has some key advantages over light and heavy water cooled reactors and concepts have been developed by Oka et al.(1999). These reactors have the potential of higher thermal efficiency as compared to the current water cooled reactors because of their higher operating temperatures: 40 to 45%. Also, since the coolant operates as a single-phase fluid, several components such as steam generators, recirculation pumps, and steam separators are eliminated, thereby simplifying the nuclear steam supply system as well as the associated power cycle. Moreover, because of the high enthalpy change associated with SCW around the pseudocritical point, the required coolant mass flow rate can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Conversely, there are some anticipated reactor engineering challenges that must be considered. The supercritical water environment may be quite corrosive for current reactor structural components as well as fuel cladding, thereby reducing the selection of suitable materials to withstand the corrosive environment, while maintaining the neutron economy. In addition to the above concern, many investigators have reported an impairment of the heat transfer coefficient under conditions of high heat flux and low mass flow rates

N2  - The fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) phenomenon has received much attention in the nuclear safety research during the past two decades. A good understanding of mechanisms of such FCI processes may be a concern in the evaluation of severe accidents. This paper presents the TEXAS-3D code, a three-dimensional transient fluid model for fuel/coolant interactions analysis developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To validate our code, we considered three standard two-phase flow problems: a classic broken dam flow, a rising bubble flow and a driven cavity flow

N2  - The imaging of photons ranging in energy from a few hundred keV to many MeV finds numerous applications in nuclear engineering and medical physics. Examples include the characterization of nuclear waste and the imaging of nuclear weapons. Acquisition of computed tomography images allows a three-dimensional rendering of the object imaged. In radiation therapy the imaging of high-energy photons is used for patient setup verification and treatment monitoring to guarantee an accurate dose delivery to the target volume. Current detector systems suffer from a low detection efficiency. An increase in the efficiency would decrease the acquisition time and, in radiation therapy, would reduce the dose to the patient. Alternatively, the image quality could be improved for a given dose. This work investigates a new approach of imaging with megavoltage photons. To increase the efficiency, a sufficient amount of metal, together with the interspersed signal-generating medium, is placed along the direction of the photon beam. A significant number of photons interact in the metal and produce high-energy electrons that deposit their energy in the signal-generating medium. A first prototype, consisting of a single detector element, was tested. The extension to a two-dimensional array was investigated with Monte Carlo simulations

N2  - In order to determine whether the EVOLVE fusion blanket design is viable, thermal-hydraulic analyses were performed on the outboard liquid lithium blanket trays. Various methodologies were employed to determine the vapor fraction distribution within these liquid metal trays. Detailed analysis of the vapor fraction is required for understanding of neutron streaming and for heat removal issues involving the liquid lithium trays. The effect of the magnetic field on the liquid lithium pool is still not fully understood and can strongly influence the potential mode of heat removal. Vapor fractions may be greater than 50% for negligible magnetic coupling between the system and the liquid lithium pool. If the magnetic field is coupled to the liquid lithium pool smaller vapor fractions are predicted, ranging up to 12%. Experiments are proposed to determine the magnitude of this coupling and ultimately the vapor fraction distribution of the liquid lithium pool

N2  - Sn<sub>x</sub>Li<sub>y</sub> and Pb<sub>x</sub>Li<sub>y</sub> eutectic alloys are being considered as liquid breeding materials for nuclear fusion applications. Thus, it is important to understand the interactions that might occur if this alloy were inadvertently to contact water. In an effort to study this interaction, experiments have been conducted with the molten alloys when impacted with a vertical 2.4 m tall column of water at 30&deg;C. The qualitative behavior of Sn<sub>75</sub>Li<sub>25</sub> was compared with similar impacts of other candidate molten metals, specifically a lithium-lead alloy, Pb<sub>83</sub>Li<sub>17</sub>. Multiple pressure spikes were produced with Sn and Pb, while essentially only one initial pressurization followed by a few strongly damped minor peaks were observed with the different lithium alloys. Hydrogen production from the lithium water interaction was measured and used to determine the extent of the chemical reaction. Dynamic pressure traces from the physical and chemical reactions are discussed and used to compare the energetics associated with the two different eutectics. It was found that the water/eutectic interactions of Pb<sub>83</sub>Li<sub>17</sub> and Sn<sub>75</sub>Li<sub>25</sub> are quite similar and significantly reduced from that of pure lithium and other reactive metals

N2  - Vapor explosions are processes involving significant energy exchange between a hot and colder, more volatile liquid. This phenomenon can cause significant pressurization and may cause damage to structures. Historically, vapor explosions have been of interest in industrial processes with molten metals, and postulated accident scenarios involving molten fuel and water in current light water reactors. With the potential use of superconducting magnets in fusion designs, postulated accident scenarios involving water used to cool various structures and cryogenic materials (i.e., helium and nitrogen) required for magnet cooling have to be addressed. A rapid increase in pressure may be seen if liquid nitrogen or helium comes into contact with water

N2  - Highly efficient photon detectors play a major role in countless applications in physics, nuclear engineering, and medical physics. In nuclear engineering, radioactive waste can be characterized with techniques such as the nondestructive assay technique (PNDA). In medical physics, photon detectors are extensively used for diagnostic X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) imaging, nuclear medicine, and quite recently radiation therapy of cancer. In radiation therapy of cancer, ever more accurate delivery techniques spur the need for efficient detectors of the high-energetic photons in the mega-electron-volt energy range in order to allow the imaging of the patient during radiation delivery. In particular, in tomotherapy, a megavoltage detector is used for both CT imaging and verifying the dose received by the patients. Conventional megavoltage detection systems usually suffer from intrinsically low subject contrast. A high signal-to-noise ratio of the detection system can be achieved by keeping the noise as low as possible and/or by increasing the quantum efficiency of the detector. In this work, a candidate of a highly efficient detection system, i.e., an arc-shaped xenon gas ionization chamber, was characterized in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution

N2  - Accidents postulated to occur involving chemical interactions of lithium with water and air are analyzed for the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) blanket test module using two different computer models. Vacuum vessel failure is not predicted for lithium leaks into water, but it is predicted in minutes for water leaks into any amount of lithium if the pressure suppression system fails to work as designed. Calculations for lithium leaks into the reactor vault containing air predict failure in an adiabatic system but not if heat loss is included.

N2  - A linear stability analysis is presented for a liquid sheet that includes the effects of the surrounding gas, surface tension and the liquid viscosity on the wave growth process. An inviscid dispersion relation is used to identify the transition from a long wavelength regime to a short wavelength regime, analogous to the first and second wind induced breakup regimes of cylindrical liquid jets. This transition, which is found to occur at a gas Weber number of 27/16, is used to simplify the viscous dispersion relation for use in multi-dimensional simulations of sheet breakup. The resulting dispersion relation is used to predict the maximum unstable growth rate and wave length, the sheet breakup length and the resulting drop size for pressure-swirl atomizers. The predicted drop size is used as a boundary condition in a multi-dimensional spray model. The results show that the model is able to accurately predict liquid spray penetration, local Sauter mean diameter and overall spray shape.

N2  - A numerical model that treats liquid and vapor as a continuum has been constructed for predicting small-scale, high-speed, cavitating nozzle flow. In order to model extremely high pressures, the compressibility of both phases has been included in the scheme, and a third-order shock-capturing technique was applied to the continuity equation to capture sharp jumps in density. In addition, a boundary-fitted mesh was used to treat different nozzle geometries. The scheme has been run with very high upstream pressures and with a liquid-to-vapor density ratio of 10,000:1. The model results have been compared to experimental measurements of single bubble collapse. Results are also presented for rounded and sharp nozzle entrances with varying upstream pressures. The model successfully predicted coefficient of discharge and exit velocity for a variety of nozzle geometries.

N2  - The new AP600 reactor designed by Westinghouse uses a passive safety system relying on heat removal by condensation to keep the containment within the design limits of pressure and temperature. Even though some research has been done so far in this regard, there are some uncertainties concerning the behavior of the system under postulated accident conditions. In this paper, steam condensation onto the internal surfaces of the AP600 containment walls has been investigated in two scaled vessels with similar aspect ratios to the actual AP600. The heat transfer degradation in the presence of noncondensable gas has been analyzed for different noncondensable mixtures of air and helium (hydrogen simulant). Molar fractions of noncondensables/steam ranged from (0.4-4.0) and helium concentrations in the noncondensable mixture were 0-50% by volume. In addition, the effects of the bulk temperatures, the mass fraction of noncondensable/steam, the cold wall surface temperature, the pressure, noncondensable composition, and the inclination of the condensing surface were studied. It was found that the heat transfer coefficients ranged from 50 to 800 J s<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> with the highest for high wall temperatures at high pressure and low noncondensable molar fractions. The effect of a light gas (helium) in the noncondensable mixture were found to be negligible for concentrations less than approximately 35 molar percent but could result in stratification at higher concentrations. The complete study gives a large and relatively complete data base on condensation within a scaled AP600 containment structure, providing an invaluable set of data against which to validate models. In addition, specific areas requiring further investigation are summarized

N2  - Past safety analyses considered the hazard from vapor explosions in a conservative manner where engineering judgement and conservative analyses were used to estimate the likelihood of nuclear reactor containment failure from explosion-induced missile generation [alpha-mode failure]. However, recent safety analyses may require less conservative methods to determine the hazard from vapor explosions; thus, one may need to consider more detailed scaling of vapor explosion energetics, considering fuel-coolant mixing and explosion propagation. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is supporting a coordinated set of experiments to address this issue, given a lack of appropriate benchmark data and associated analyses. These experiments, KROTOS, WFCI and ZrEX are mutually complimentary and provide the first consistent set of data for FCI phenomena under controlled conditions for a wide range of simulant materials that approximate the fuel melt. The scaling logic for these tests is that essentially one-dimensional geometry with rigid constraints would maximize the explosion energetics for a given set of mixing conditions. Thus, only variations in the axial boundary conditions and fuel-coolant initial conditions (mass, composition and temperatures) can affect the mixing and energetics. Our hypothesis is that clear limits to energetics below thermodynamic values can be identified for these high temperature fuel melts along with fundamental understanding, which can aid in issue resolution

N2  - Stratified Fuel-Coolant Interaction (FCI) experiments with Refrigerant-134a and water were performed in a large-scale system. Air was uniformly injected into the coolant pool to establish a pre-existing void which could suppress the explosion. Two competing effects due to the variation of the air flow rate seem to influence the intensity of the explosion in this geometrical configuration. At low flow rates, although the injected air increases the void fraction, the concurrent agitation and mixing increases the intensity of the interaction. At higher flow rates, the increase in void fraction tends to attenuate the propagated pressure wave generated by the explosion. Experimental results show a complete suppression of the vapor explosion at high rates of air injection, corresponding to an average void fraction of larger than 30%

N2  - The occurrence of an energetic fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) below the reactor pressure vessel in the cavity of advanced light water reactors (ALWRs) are analyzed to determine the possible hazard to structural walls as a result of dynamic liquid phase pressures. Such analyses are important to demonstrate that these cavity walls will maintain their integrity so that ex-vessel core debris coolability is possible. Past studies that have examined this or related issues are reviewed, and a methodology is proposed to analyze the occurrence of this physical event using the IFCI and TEXAS models for the FCI as well as dynamic shock wave propagation estimates using hand calculations as well as the CTN hydro model. Scenarios for the ALWRs are reviewed, and one severe accident scenario is used as an example to demonstrate the methodology. Such methodologies are recommended for consideration in future safety studies. These methodologies should be verified with direct comparison to energetic FCI data such as that being produced in KROTOS at the Joint Research Centre, Ispra

N2  - It has been recognized that the potentially explosive interaction between molten core materials, which are partially metallic, and coolant is a concern in the risk assessment of severe nuclear reactor accidents. Such an interaction can produce steam and hydrogen at rapid rates by steam oxidation of the metallic content of the melt, and potentially a large release of mechanical energy. At present, the role hydrogen generation plays in the fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) process has not been well understood. Experimental studies have been done and simple models developed for hydrogen generation based on empirical data, with a few studies modeling the FCI process with hydrogen generation. This paper presents a physical model for simulating FCI processes in TEXAS-V with chemical reactions. Such a model can achieve a better understanding of the role played by metal oxidation in experiments during the FCI processes of premixing, triggering, and explosion phases

N2  - In a postulated reactor accident, the loss of coolant results in a release of high-temperature steam into the containment. Under these circumstances, steam condensation onto containment walls provides an effective mechanism of energy removal. However, the presence of noncondensable gas is known to degrade the heat transfer. It has also been found that the introduction of a light noncondensable gas has little effect until sufficient quantities are present to disrupt the buoyancy forces. Our investigation shows the dramatic effect of high concentrations of light gas, decreasing steam condensation rates under anticipated accident conditions for AP600, with helium as the simulant for hydrogen

N2  - Because water-cooled molten Pb-17 A/O Li eutectic is being considered as a breeder/blanket for nuclear fusion, we must understand the interactions that occur if this alloy inadvertently contacts liquid water. We have, therefore, compared the behaviour of 120 g of the molten alloy with that of 140 g of molten lead, both at 600&deg;C when impacted with a vertical 2.4 m-tall column of water at 25&deg;C or 60&deg;C. (Temperatures and weights are nominal.) The intent of this study was to determine differences between the fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) behaviours of a chemically reactive melt, the PbLi alloy, and of an inert material, Pb. H<sub>2</sub> and aqueous solutions of LiOH, both potentially hazardous, were generated with the alloy, but not with the Pb. Although significant chemical reaction occurred with the alloy, no augmentation of the energetics was measured nor was there any indication of runaway metal ignition. The observations can be interpreted as the typical FCI phenomena seen in shock tube geometry, i.e., hydrodynamic forced mixing of melt by water column impact driving thermal interaction at the melt-water interface. Chemical reactions seem to follow this melt-water contact, moderating, not augmenting, the energetics

N2  - A new facility has been developed to study the explosive interactions of gas-water injection into a molten tin pool. The experimental apparatus allows for variable nitrogen gas and water injection into the base of a steel tank containing molten tin. A first set of experiments based on gas injection only, has been used to develop a diagnostic technique using real-time high energy X-rays to observe the mixing process and measure local and average void fraction in the test section. Void fraction measurements with superficial gas injection rates of 7.0 cm/sec to 14 cm/sec into an 8 cm deep pool of 683 K molten tin, indicate that the average void fraction at these gas injection rates is relatively constant, in the range of 36% to 40%. Similar injections into a pool of 14 to 15 cm depths exhibited void fractions in the range of 18% to 23%. Initial experiments with simultaneous water and nitrogen gas injection have demonstrated the ability to produce energetic interactions in the coolant injection geometry with water flow rates of 0.8&times;10<sup>-2</sup> kg/sec to 2.5&times;10<sup>-2</sup> kg/sec

N2  - Experimental observation has shown that the assumption of complete fuel fragmentation in a vapor explosion by the shock adiabatic thermodynamic model results in predicting upper bounds for the shock pressure, propagation velocity, and work output. This model has been modified by considering the condition where the assumption of complete fragmentation of the fuel is relaxed. A methodology is adopted using experimental values of the shock pressure and propagation velocity to estimate the initial mixture conditions of the experiment and the mass fraction of the materials participating in the explosion. Analysis of a steady-state subcritical vapor explosion in one dimension has been carried out by applying the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy and the appropriate equation of state for a homogeneous mixture of molten tin and water. The KROTOS-21 experiment, conducted at the Joint Research Center at Ispra, Italy, was used as the initial benchmark experiment n this analysis. A quasi-steady explosion pressure of ~3 MPa and a propagation velocity of ~200 m/s were obtained in this experiment. Using this model, the estimated minimum mass of the fragmented fuel was found to be 0.21 kg (3.2%) of the total mass of the fuel. The predicted work output by this model corresponding to the aforementioned fragmented fuel mass was found to be 9.8 kJ. The estimated initial void fraction of the vapor was found to be 11.5%. In these analyses, a comparison is made of the various possible closure relations applied to the detonation wave theory for a vapor explosion and associated concerns of model stability in the two-phase region

N2  - To investigate liquid-metal (fuel)/water (coolant) interactions, a vertical shock tube has been designed and constructed. A series of tests was conducted with gallium, indium, lead, and tin as the fuel materials at either &ldquo;low&rdquo; (T<sub>f</sub>~300&deg;C) or &ldquo;high&rdquo; fuel temperature (T<sub>f</sub>~600&deg;C), with water at room temperature (low T<sub>c</sub>) and in the range of T<sub>c</sub>=56 to 67&deg;C (high T<sub>c</sub>), and with driving pressures from 0.25 to 1.22 MPa. These materials were tested to determine their compatibility for potential rise in liquid-metal divertor systems for fusion power plants. The increase in fuel and water temperature, as well as the increase of driving pressure, caused more energetic interactions to occur. High T<sub>f</sub> tin and lead interactions, and high T<sub>f</sub> and T<sub>c</sub> gallium and indium interactions were the most energetic. Stronger interactions produced finer debris fragments. In high T<sub>f</sub> gallium and indium interactions, small superficial oxidation was observed. For the first two pulses, larger ratios of compression (compression of expansion vessel gas)-to-expansion work correspond to the experiments with higher fuel and coolant temperatures. For the first pulse, only work ratio values of the most energetic experiments are larger than those of isothermal experiments. Consequently, for such experiments, the impulse values of second pulses are the largest. Higher values of the conversion ratio for the first pulse correspond to more energetic interactions. Even for the most energetic experiments, the conversion ratio is no higher than 1.2%, and no more than 15% (or a few millimeters-thick surface layer) of the initially loaded fuel participated in the interaction, assuming equal initial volumes of fuel and coolant

N2  - Detonation wave theory was applied to the physical process of a vapor explosion. Initially, our experimental observations using hot water as the fuel and saturated refrigerant liquid as the coolant were analyzed with this technique. These tests are notable since peak explosion pressures were far below the critical pressure of the coolant. From the analysis, the volume fractions of the coolant vapor and the volume ratio of the two liquids prior to the explosion were estimated from the measured peak explosion pressures and associated explosion propagation velocities under the assumption that the process was steady and one-dimensional. Complete Hugoniot curves were constructed, and the detonation condition was initially determined under the assumption that flow velocity behind the shock was equal to the mixture sound speed. This assumption was checked with the tangency condition between the Rayleigh line and Hugoniot curve at the Chapman-Jouguet point, as well as the existence of a minimum in the entropy change across the shock wave. The point of minimum entropy showed good agreement with the graphical tangency point, but was slightly different than the sound speed criteria in pressure (&lt;2%) with a larger difference in propagation speed (50%). This discrepancy between the three criteria becomes insignificant as the explosion pressure rises. This is demonstrated by examining a tin-water explosion experiment. This technique appears to be a useful tool to estimate initial conditions for subcritical vapor explosions

N2  - A theoretical model has been developed for molten metal/water interactions by using a semiempirical heat transfer correlation and a mass transfer analogy to predict the metal ignition threshold temperatures for aluminum and zirconium. The predictions of the aluminum and zirconium metal temperature responses are studied to identify self-propagating chemical reactions that lead to metal ignition for various metal particle sizes and initial temperatures. The results showed that the ignition of the aluminum metal is possible when the aluminum oxide layer remains in the liquid phase until the metal temperature reaches its oxide layer solidification temperature under highly transient conditions. For both metals, the ignition temperature increased with a larger size of the metal particle, with zirconium requiring qualitatively larger temperatures for ignitions. It was observed that the effect of the water temperature strongly depends on where the chemical reaction front may actually be located

N2  - Twenty scoping experiments were performed to investigate the behavior of nominally 0.5 g molten lithium drops when released into 0.7 L of the organic coolant Therminol 66 at local atmospheric pressure using a vortex insertion technique. Diagnostics consisted of video and photographic imaging and several chemical analyses. Six coolant/Li temperature pairs were used: 300/300; 300/530; 300/770; 464/530; 600/530 and 600/770, all nominal in K. Because the coolant: Li weight ratio was 10<sup>3</sup> only rapid (-0.5 s) quenching reactions could be studied when T<sub>Li</sub>&gt;T<sub>c</sub>; when T<sub>Li</sub>&les;T<sub>c</sub>, however, both rapid and slower (min) interactions could be investigated. In none of the experiments was there any indication of (a) a vigorous, self-sustaining chemical reaction between the lithium and the organic coolant, or (b) the formation of water-insoluble debris, in particular carbon. Our work confirms the benign behavior at similar temperatures reported earlier by others

N2  - Metallurgical observations of boat samples from the TMI-2 pressure vessel suggest a hot spot of approximately one-meter diameter developed on the vessel inner surface during the transient period following core relocation. It was postulated that the hot spot was generated as a result of an impinging jet on the vessel. Calculations have been performed to determine the thermal history of the vessel following jet impingement, accounting for jet breakup during the pour into the lower plenum, the partitioning of energy delivered between the lower plenum water and the vessel lower head, and the growth of crusts and internal convection cells in the relocated debris. Results indicate the hot spot did not evolve from jet impingement. Results from vessel thermal response calculations, which were dominated by input based upon companion-sample examinations, were not consistent with peak temperatures or cooling rates within the hot spot indicated by boat sample examinations

N2  - A vapor explosion is the phenomena in which a hot liquid rapidly transfers its internal energy into a surrounding colder and more volatile liquid. Three series of experiments (WFCI) were conducted to investigate the vapor explosion in 1-D large scale geometry. The first test series was performed to verify experiment reproducibility, the second investigated the spontaneous explosion and the third was conducted to show the effect of an external trigger on the vapor explosion. All the data indicate that the explosion energetics are reproducible for similar initial conditions. Most of the vapor explosions observed in these experiments showed multiple propagations through the fuel-coolant mixture until the mixture expanded against the inertial constraint. However, if the external trigger was strong, the data showed a single explosion. Finally the explosion conversion ratio is measured to be low (less than 1%). This may be explained by the hypothesis that only a small fraction of the fuel is fragmented and quenched on the explosion timescale. Analysis using a C-J detonation model along with debris size distribution are consistent with this hypothesis

N2  - The occurrence of an energetic fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) below the reactor pressure vessel in the cavity of advanced light water reactors (ALWRs) must be analyzed to determine the possible hazard to structural walls as a result of dynamic liquid phase pressures. Such analyses are important to demonstrate that these cavity walls will maintain their integrity so that ex-vessel core debris coolability is assured. This paper reviews past studies which have examined this or related issues and proposes a methodology to analyze the occurrence of this physical event using the IFCI and TEXAS models for the FCI as well as dynamic shock waves propagation estimates using hand calculations as well as the CTH hydro-model. Scenarios for the ALWRs are reviewed and one severe accident scenario is used to demonstrate the methodology. It is recommended that such methodologies be considered in future safety studies and be verified with direct comparison to energetic FCI data

N2  - The interaction of molten-lithium droplets with water is studied experimentally. In one set of experiments, droplets of ~10- to 15-mm diameter are injected into a vessel filled with water. The reaction is filmed, and pressure measurements are made. The initial metal and water temperatures range from 200 to 500&deg;C and 20 to 70&deg;C, respectively. It is found that when reactant temperatures are high, an explosive reaction often occurs. When the initial lithium temperature is &gt;400&deg;C and the water is &gt;30&deg;C, the explosive reactions become much more probable, with pressure peaks as high as 4 MPa. The reaction is modeled to explain the temperature threshold for this metal-ignition phenomena. Results with the model support the hypothesis that explosive reactions occur when the lithium droplet surface reaches its saturation temperature while the hydrogen film surrounding the drop is relatively thin

N2  - The risk estimate for nuclear power plants is often based on source term calculations done by computationally intensive severe reactor accident simulations. These fluid dynamics codes balance mass, energy, and momentum over a network of control volumes by solving large, coupled sets of ordinary differential equations. Generally, these codes are not run-time optimized and they take no advantage of the advancements in computer architectures such as vector or parallel processing. Most popular examples of these nuclear accident codes are MELCOR and RELAP5. As parallel computing finds its way into production level industrial real-time applications, one wonders what the best simulation model and best architecture are for nuclear applications. Although far from answering such a question, we have conducted research on the parallel performance of 2 major fluid codes, including a non-nuclear 3-D fluid code (KIVA) in addition to MELCOR and HECTR

N2  - A study has been performed to investigate the effects of surfactants on single droplet vapor explosions. Laser-heated, 80-mg droplets of molten iron oxide were dropped into a chamber of distilled water, where an explosive interaction was initiated with a piston-generated pressure wave. Peak pressures generated, explosion efficiency, and explosion debris size were the parameters used to quantify the explosion intensity. Two surfactants were used in the study: athoxilated-nonyle-phenole (Emulgator) and sodium-dodecyl-benzene (UFASAN). Over 80 experiments were conducted

N2  - Time resolved measurements of non-evaporating, non-burning fuel sprays injected into a quiescent atmosphere were performed. The experimental parameters included ambient gas density, mass of fuel injected per stroke, pump speed, and nozzle diameter. High speed films of fuel sprays were obtained using a rapidly pulsed Cu-vapor laser in synchronization with a high frame rate film camera. The laser light intensity transmitted through the spray was recorded directly by the film camera. The information encoded on the film was subsequently digitized using a projector/CCD camera system. Finally, instantaneous ensemble averaged properties of droplets constituting the spray were estimated by quantitative analysis of the digitized transmission images. These measured properties included the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) averaged over the entire spray or over a given cross-section. In addition, the images yielded other spray parameters such as tip penetration, cone angle, and injection duration. The results showed that SMD decreased as injection proceeded. Furthermore, the SMD approached an asymptotic size. Longitudinal variation of SMD at a specific time indicated that the size reached a minimum in the spray interior. These results were compared with other data obtained with a phase-Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA) [1] utilized on the same experimental configuration. Comparison with a breakup model developed at UW-Madison [2] as well as other models was made. The data of this study are in reasonable agreement with both the PDPA data and these spray models.

N2  - Recent analyses indicate that the vapor explosion hazard may not be as severe as first thought when a hot molten liquid contacts a volatile coolant. However, benchmark data must be compared to available explosion models to verify this judgment. A series of calculations were recently performed to illustrate the predictive capabilities of the mechanistic vapor explosion model UWFCI. One needs to continually assess and compare relevant experimental data to understand the model limitations and where physical insights are revealed. The availability of reliable unambiguous vapor explosion data on explosion propagation/yield is very limited

N2  - Investigations are performed to study the mixing between immiscible liquids in a pool configuration due to an upward gas flow. A water-R113 system is used in the bubbly/churn-turbulent regimes to determine the effects of the unagitated pool depth on layer mixing. The superficial gas velocity at which full mixing is attained is observed to increase with the pool depth, although it is concluded that this is a weak dependency. Mixing in the churn-turbulent regime is studied with Wood's metal-water and Wood's metal-silicone fluid (100 cS) as pairs of fluids. Additional past mixing data from six other fluids are also included in the data base. A criterion is proposed to determine if two liquids will entrain in bubbly or churn-turbulent flow. Correlations are derived that, for a set of given conditions, allow prediction of the mixing state (mixed or segregated) of a system. Because of the indirect method of measuring the mixed layer thickness, pool void fraction experiments are also performed

N2  - A vapor explosion is a physical event in which a hot liquid (fuel) transfers its internal energy to a colder, more volatile liquid (coolant): thus the coolant vaporizes at high pressures and expands and does work on its surroundings. In postulated severe accidents in current fission reactors, vapor explosions are considered if this molten `fuel' contacts residual water in-vessel or ex-vessel because these physical explosions have the potential to contribute to reactor vessel failure and possibly containment failure and release of radioactive fission products. Current safety analyses and probabilistic studies consider this process with the use of explosion models. Eventually these models must be compared with available experimental data to determine their validity. This study provides a comprehensive review of vapour explosion experiments for eventual use in such comparisons. Also, when there are insufficient data, experiments are suggested that can provide the needed information for future comparisons. This review may be useful for light-water-reactor as well as noncommercial reactor safety studies

N2  - An experimental investigation of stratified vapor explosions and scaling is conducted by constructing test sections of two different sizes and using two different fluid pairs. The horizontal lengths of the interaction vessels are 20 and 50 cm (geometric scale ratio: 2:5). The two liquid pairs are water and liquid nitrogen, and water and Freon-12, with water being the hot liquid. The interactions are either triggered by an external trigger or allowed to occur spontaneously depending on the liquid pair and initial conditions. The major experimental variables are initial water temperature, liquid layer depths, and magnitude of the external trigger pressure. Interaction pressures, mechanical work release, and depth of intermixing are measured. The water/Freon-12 pair produces more violent interactions than the water/liquid nitrogen. In both cases, the explosion propagation speeds are supersonic, ranging from 40 to 250 m/s. The small depths (&les;1 cm) of liquid-liquid mixing during the explosion propagation are observed in both liquid pairs. A simple model for the depth of in term intermixing is derived, and the result shows reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The length of the liquid layer interface and the depth of the top liquid appear to be the key geometric parameters in stratified vapor explosions

N2  - An experimental investigation to examine the effect of surface orientation on the condensation of steam in the presence of a noncondensable gas is reported. An air-steam mixture is directed into a rectangular flow-channel over a condensing aluminum surface which has a painted wetting surface finish. In order to simulate a flat plate geometry as closely as possible, measurements were done in the region where flow was still developing. In this series of experiments the orientation of the condensing surface was varied from 0-90&deg; (plate surface facing downwards to 0&deg;), with a variable air-steam mass ratio of 0.24-0.8, and a mixture velocity of 1-3 m/s. The heat transfer coefficient was measured as well as making visual observations of the condensation process. The heat transfer coefficient varied from 100 to 600 W/m<sup>2</sup>K. In comparison to the previous set of experiments with a bare polished aluminium surface the results showed an increase of 50-200% from upward facing bare surface, but lower than the downward facing bare surface more than 30%. The observed differences are attributed to the mode of condensation. A filmwise condensation mode prevailed throughout the current tests. The heat transfer coefficient decreased with the angle and increased with the flow velocity. The results are compared with some previously published data and a condensation model which show reasonable agreement with the data trends.

N2  - Experimental work and supporting analysis have been conducted by Westinghouse Hanford Company and the University of Wisconsin on lithium-lead alloy chemical reactivity. This work is in support of the US Department of Energy Fusion Safety Program through EG&amp;G Idaho Inc. These studies involve experiments with lithium-lead (17Li83Pb) and its interactions with air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, concrete steam and water. The work at Westinghouse Hanford has been done to characterize potential safety concerns associated with the use of this alloy as a breeding and/or coolant material in fusion reactors. These activities primarily involve large and small scale integral experiments. The work at Wisconsin has focused on lithium alloy/water interactions and is concerned with the chemical kinetics in small scale separate effects tests. In addition this work has been complemented by larger scale more prototypic tests and associated analyses at JRC Ispra. The authors discuss recent results and the status of their knowledge

N2  - The vapor explosion process can involve the mixing of fuel with coolant prior to the explosion. A number of analysts have suggested limits to the amount of fuel/coolant mixing that could occur within the reactor vessel following a core melt accident. Past models are reviewed and a simplified approach is suggested to estimate a limit on the amount of fuel/coolant mixing possible. The approach uses concepts first advanced by Fauske in a different way. The results indicate that fuel temperature, ambient pressure and in particular the mixing length scale D<sub>mix</sub> are important parameters. For large values of D<sub>mix</sub> the fuel mass mixed in-vessel is limited to the range of 1-12 metric tons (1-10% of the core mass.)

N2  - Satisfactory agreement of the theoretical and experimental results of the condensation phenomenon at low pressures and densities has not been achieved. One influence is the presence of noncondensable gases. The general tendency in the modelling of the condensation process is to improve the theoretical models with the aid of the Boltzmann equation set for the vapor/gas mixtures, resulting in the use of simplified mathematical forms of the equation. Another possible technique to solve the problem is to provide a computer analog with an approximate relationship to the real flow which models the physical processes included in condensation without direct reference to the Boltzmann equation. This technique is employed by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The condensation of a monatomic metal vapor at low pressures and densities is studied in the presence of a noncondensable gas with different partial pressures

N2  - Direct containment heating is a phenomenon identified to occur in a light water reactor during a meltdown accident at high system pressures at the time of vessel breach. Immediate containment failure may result from this process due to overpressure and overtemperature loads. This study focuses on the `science' of direct heating and the reactor safety criteria and issues that must be addressed to assure the threat to containment is minimized. This discussion attempts to be tutorial in nature with the broader context of melt-coolant-atmosphere interactions being emphasized. From this discussion future research needs may be suggested

N2  - A fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) is a physical event in which a hot liquid (fuel) fragments and transfers its internal energy to a colder, more volatile liquid (coolant). If the fragmentation rate is rapid enough the event becomes explosive; i.e. a vapor explosion. The authors briefly review the regulatory issues involving an FCI and the current status of understanding recent progress with regard to explosion scaling and analysis of the fuel-coolant mixing and quenching. Explosion propagation is also discussed. Finally, current observations and possible future directions are discussed

N2  - Vapor is produced from the ICF event as the x-ray energy is deposited at the first wall of the reactor. This vapor must condense back onto the first wall in a timely fashion (&lt;&lt; 1 s) to establish the necessary conditions for beam propagation and the next ICF event. Transient condensation of vapor is studied on the basis of the Boltzmann equation using a direct simulation Monte Carlo Method. The method describes the molecular behavior of continuum mechanics transition flows in a way consistent with the Boltzmann equation. The thermal resistance of the condensed film is included in the flow representation using a laminar Nusselt analysis to determine the interface temperature of the condensed film. The condensate mass flux in a quasi-steady state is computed and compared with a number of analytical models and experimental data. The results are consistent qualitatively with the experimental data of mercury condensation on a vertical plate.

N2  - In a severe accident in a light water reactor, a molten mixture of fuel and metals could be deposited onto the concrete floor below the vessel. The subsequent molten core-concrete interaction (MCCI) is of concern particularly in its early phase when concrete erosion rates (and associated decomposition gases) and aerosols produced from the reaction may be large. The rate and type of aerosol production is a function of the chemistry between the pool and the decomposition gases released. Both these processes are driven by the hydrodynamics of the molten pool, and the heat transfer between it and the concrete. Recently experiments have begun at Argonne to specifically address the question of aerosol production from the MCCI at early times

N2  - An experimental investigation has begun to examine the effect of surface orientation on the condensation of steam in the presence of a noncondensible gas. An air-steam mixture is directed into a flow-channel over a condensing aluminum surface. In this series of experiments the orientation of the condensing surface was varied from 0-75&deg; (plate surface facing downwards at 0&deg;), with a variable air/steam mass ratio of .3-7, and a mixture velocity of 1-3ml/s. The heat transfer coefficient was measured as well as making visual observations of the condensation process. The results showed enhanced heat transfer rates up to three times higher than at the angle of 180$DGR.

N2  - A fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) is a phenomenon that may occur during a light water reactor severe accident when molten fuel comes into contact with residual water in-vessel or in the reactor containment. A new one-dimensional mutifluid transient model, which currently has the capability of examining nonexplosive FCI behavior, is described. A unique dynamic fuel fragmentation model based on relative velocities was incorporated into this model along with other constitutive relations. The model was compared to the limited FCI data on mixing and nonexplosive FCI events and shows relatively good agreement. In addition, a set of FCI parametric calculations for in-vessel fuel-coolant mixing was performed to gain insight into the important variable affecting mixing (i.e., pressure, water depth, multiple jets) and the initial conditions for the explosion.

N2  - The results from the BETA molten core/concrete interaction (MCCI) experiments conducted at Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (KfK) and the associated analyses using computer models developed by KfK and by Sandia National Laboratories, i.e. WECHSL and CORCON, are described. Two important observations were made in the BETA steady-state tests: 1. a distinctly larger downward erosion rate than previously measured in transient tests or predicted 2. dispersion and mixing of the metallic layer in the oxidic layer at high-melt input powers and associated gas velocities. The first observation could be modeled by WECHSL and CORCON by modifications when interface heat transfer considered a `transition boiling' analogy model. The second observation was not modeled but is expected to be important during the high-temperature phase of the MCCI when fission product release is of concern. These results suggest that the BETA experiments provide necessary information to validate MCCI models for silicate (basaltic) concrete. For limestone (carbonatic) concrete, there are still open questions that further tests must address

N2  - Vapor is produced from the ICF event as the X-ray energy is deposited at the first wall of the reactor. This vapor must condense back onto the first wall in a timely fashion (&Lt;1 s) to establish the necessary conditions for beam propagation and the next ICF event. Transient condensation of vapor is studied on the basis of the Boltzmann equation using a direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The method describes the molecular behavior of continuum mechanics transition flows in a way consistent with the Boltzmann equation. The thermal resistance of the condensed film is included in the flow representation using a laminar Nusselt analysis to determine the interface temperature of the condensed film. The condensate mass flux in a quasi-steady state is computed and compared with a number of analytical models and experimental data. The results are consistent qualitatively with the experimental data of mercury condensation on a vertical plate

N2  - A series of single droplet vapor explosion experiments were conducted to investigate the suppressive effects on explosion triggering. In these tests laser-melted iron-oxide droplets were injected into a large water pool. The major variables were the coolant viscosity and the external trigger which induces the explosion. Over sixty experiments were conducted. The nominal behavior (&mu;=0.001 kg/ms) showed the molten iron-oxide droplet entering the water in stable film boiling. When the trigger pressure wave was applied, the vapor film rapidly collapses (&lt;200 &mu;sec), the fuel is fragmented (1-100 &mu;m), and a steam bubble is produced which expands in the surrounding liquid. An increase in fuel mass did not alter this behavior, although it did provide more mass for this process to become more cyclic in nature. The increase of coolant viscosity (&gt;0.05 kg/ms) at fixed trigger pressure (and impulse) resulted in complete explosion suppression. As the trigger pressure was increased the explosion could be triggered for intermediate viscosities, but suppression still remained for high viscosities (&gt;0.15 kg/ms). The explosion conversion ratio varied from 0-6%

Techniques utilizing a thermal anemometer for measurement of amplitude, frequency, wavelength, and film thickness were developed in isothermal air-water flow and were then applied to condensing air/steam-water flow. Heat transfer coefficients were measured as a function of length along the condensing surfaces.

N2  - A vapour explosion is a physical event in which a hot liquid (fuel) rapidly fragments and transfers its internal energy to a colder, more volatile liquid (coolant); in so doing, the coolant vaporizes at high pressures and expands, doing work on its surroundings. In present day fission reactors, if complete and prolonged failure of normal and emergency coolant flow occurs, fission product decay heat would cause melting of the reactor materials. In postulated severe accident analyses vapour explosions are considered if this molten `fuel' contacts residual water in-vessel or ex-vessel, because these physical explosions have the potential of contributing to reactor vessel failure and possibly containment failure and release of radioactive fission products

The WASH-1400 reactor safety study termed this containment failure mechanism 'alpha-mode failure'. The comments are divided into four general categories: (a) the subjective nature of this work, (b) limitations of the study, (c) documents, and (d) technical comments on the remainder of the study (Part II, III, and IV).

N2  - A description is given of the preliminary analysis of LOFA (loss-of-flow accident) and LOCA (loss-of-coolant accident) in the TIBER-II engineering test reactor breeding shield. The use of tungsten in the inboard shield implies a rather high rate of afterheat on plasma shutdown, which must be dissipated in a controlled manner to avoid the possibility of radioactivity release or threatening the investment. Because the shield is cooled with an aqueous solution, LOFA does not pose a problem as long as natural convection can be established. LOCA, however, has more serious consequences, particularly on the inboard side. Circulation of air by natural convection is proposed as a means for dissipating the inboard shield decay heat. The safety and environmental implications of such a scheme are evaluated. It is shown that the inboard shield temperature never exceeds 510&deg;C following LOCA posing no hazard to reactor personnel and not threatening the investment

N2  - The Ra tandem mirror fusion reactor concept features inherent safety, high net plant efficiency, low cost of electricity, low radioactive waste generation, low activation, highly efficient direct conversion, thin radiation shields, and axisymmetric magnets. The safety and environment features are achieved through the use of D-<sup>3</sup>He fuel, while the high efficiency derived from a novel operating mode ICRF (ion cyclotron range-of-frequencies) stabilization allows an axisymmetric magnet set. The Ra concept requires an economic source of <sup>3</sup>He, such as proposed lunar resources, and a modest physics extension of the requirements for a deuterium-tritium (D-T) tandem mirror reactor. The three critical technology areas for a Ra-mode reactor are the high-energy neutral beams, fueling, and the high-voltage direct converter

N2  - In a nuclear reactor, the containment represents the final barrier to fission product release following a severe accident. The timing and manner of containment loading are important in determining if a failure occurs and the magnitude of radioactivity release. A variety of computer models have been developed to analyze severe accidents and in particular the containment. Recently, physical processes are of interest involving fuel/coolant interactions, hydrogen combustion, and direct heating following reactor pressure vessel (RPV) breach with containment feedback. Based on this need the HMC code was developed. The authors discuss scoping calculations using HMC to investigate containment loads for the Surry reactor under a variety of parametric boundary and initial conditions (low and high RPV pressures) at the time of vessel breach

N2  - A transient film boiling model was developed to study the film boiling dynamics that would occur when a molten, spherical fuel droplet is immersed in a coolant. The focus of this study was to investigate the effects of noncondensable gas, coolant temperature and ambient pressure on film boiling during the initial growth phase. These parameters were found to have the greatest influence on the triggering of the small scale fuel-coolant interactions. The results indicate that the film generally stabilizes with more noncondensable gas present and higher coolant temperatures. The calculations indicate that small ambient pressurizations caused violent fluctuation of the film pressure while higher ambient pressures suppress these oscillations. These results are in good agreement with Nelson's (1981) experimental data for a single duel droplet in water

N2  - Dimensional analysis is applied to Nelson's small-scale steam explosion experiments (1981, 1982) to determine the qualitative effect of each relevant parameter for triggering a steam explosion. According to experimental results, the liquid entrapment model seems to be a consistent explanation for the steam explosion triggering mechanism. The three-dimensional oscillatory wave motion of the vapor/liquid interface is analyzed to determine the necessary conditions for local condensation and production of a coolant microjet to be entrapped in fuel. It is proposed that different contact modes between fuel and coolant may involve different initiation mechanisms of steam explosions

N2  - A primary goal in the MINIMARS fusion power reactor design is to achieve the lowest possible cost of electricity and highest mass utilization while maintaining credibility and passive safety. Because the blanket impacts many components, reducing its thickness while achieving adequate breeding and a high energy multiplication is of prime importance. The authors describe the blanket design and performance

N2  - The vapor explosion process involves the mixing of fuel with coolant prior to the explosion. A number of analysts have identified limits of the amount of fuel/coolant mixing that could occur within the reactor vessel following a core melt accident. Past models are reviewed and a simplified approach is suggested to estimate the upper limit on the amount of fuel/coolant mixing possible. The approach uses concepts first advanced by Fauske (1974) in a different way. The results indicate that water depth is an important parameter as well as the mixing length scale <i>D</i><sub>mix</sub>, and for large values of <i>D</i><sub>mix</sub> the fuel mass mixed is limited to &lt;7% of the core mass

N2  - In a fuel/coolant interaction, interfacial area is the important variable for accurately predicting the steam generation rate; it should be modeled not only for its final drop size or total breakup time but also for the detailed drop size history during breakup. In past experiments, data over a wide range of Weber numbers only measured the total breakup times and final fragment sizes. However, it has been difficult to measure the drop size history experimentally during the breakup process. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to predict theoretically the droplet size history during hydrodynamic breakup

N2  - If complete failure of normal and emergency coolant flow occurs in a light water reactor (LWR), fission product decay heat would eventually cause melting of the reactor fuel and cladding. Suppose the molten fuel has fallen into the coolant and premixed to some specified diameter. When an explosion is triggered, the molten fuel rapidly fragments and transfers its energy to the coolant within a short time (&lt;1 s). The subsequent steam explosion depends on the complicated processes of fuel fragmentation and mixing as well as the heat transfer mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to assess the important initial conditions in determining the explosion conversion ratio of fuel thermal energy to mechanical energy steam generation rates, and pressure history with the phenomenological model to better characterize processes during a severe reactor accident

N2  - In a low-pressure severe core-melt accident sequence, the molten core will pour into the reactor cavity. To assess the possibility of a containment failure, it is important to know the extent of corium coolant mixing. Knowing this, the magnitude of the ensuing `steam spike' and the initial conditions for the molten corium/concrete interaction can then be concluded
