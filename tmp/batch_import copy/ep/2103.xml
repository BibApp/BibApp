			Abstract="Acoustoelastic analysis has usually been applied to compressible engineering materials. Many materials (e.g., rubber and biologic materials) are &#x22;nearly&#x22; incompressible and often assumed incompressible in their constitutive equations. These material models do not admit dilatational waves for acoustoelastic analysis. Other constitutive models (for these materials) admit compressibility but still do not model dilatational waves with fidelity (shown herein). In this article a new strain energy function is formulated to model dilatational wave propagation in nearly incompressible, isotropic materials. This strain energy function requires four material constants and is a function of Cauchy-Green deformation tensor invariants. This function and existing (compressible) strain energy functions are compared based upon their ability to predict dilatational wave propagation in uniaxially prestressed rubber. Results demonstrate deficiencies in existing functions and the usefulness of our new function for acoustoelastic applications. Our results also indicate that acoustoelastic analysis has great potential for the accurate prediction of active or residual stresses in nearly incompressible materials.

			Abstract="An existing logarithmic time base pulse generator design has been modified to collect data for creep and relaxation tests over at least 14 decades of logarithmic time increments. Creep and relaxation studies of materials, which do not obey time temperature superposition, are done over many factors of ten (decades) of time. To acquire and store data efficiently one employs logarithmic sampling intervals. This device can trigger a data acquisition system to gather the data logarithmically. It generates trigger pulses accurately over 14 decades of time. &#x26;copy; 2005 American Institute of Physics."

			Abstract="Die-cast aluminum alloys are heavily used in small engines, where they are subjected to long-term stresses at elevated temperatures. The resulting time-dependent material responses can result in inefficient engine operation and failure. A method to analytically determine the stress relaxation response directly from creep tests and to accurately interpolate between experimental time-history curves would be of great value. Constant strain, stress relaxation tests and constant load, creep tests were conducted on aluminum die-casting alloys: B-390, eutectic Al-Si and a 17% Si-Al alloy. A nonlinear superposition integral was used to (i) interpolate between empirical primary inelastic creep-strain and stress-relaxation time histories and (ii) to determine the stress relaxation response from corresponding creep data. Using isochronal stress-strain curves, prediction of the creep response at an intermediate stress level from empirical creep curves at higher and lower stresses resulted in a correlation (R) of 0.98. Similarly for relaxation, correlations of 0.98 were obtained for the prediction of an intermediate strain level curve from higher and lower empirical relaxation curves. The theoretical prediction of stress relaxation from empirical creep curves fell within 10% of experimental data"

			Abstract="The goal of this study was to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of the rabbit medial collateral ligament (MCL) at multiple levels of strain (between 0% and ~5%) and their corresponding stresses (between 0 and ~55 MPa) for stress relaxation and creep, respectively. We hypothesized that in the rabbit MCL the rate of stress relaxation would be strain dependent and the rate of creep would be stress dependent. Thirty MCLs from 15 rabbits were tested ex vivo for this study. Results show that within the physiologically relevant region of ligament behavior, the rate of stress relaxation is strain dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of relaxation decreasing with increasing tissue strain. The rate of creep is stress dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of creep decreasing with increasing stress. These results support our hypothesis, with the greatest nonlinearities in a physiologically relevant region of loading. As such, these nonlinearities should be considered when quantifying ligament viscoelastic behavior with a rabbit model"

			Abstract="Creep and stress relaxation are known to be interrelated in linearly viscoelastic materials by an exact analytical expression. In this article, analytical interrelations are derived for nonlinearly viscoelastic materials which obey a single integral nonlinear superposition constitutive equation. The kernel is not assumed to be separable as a product of strain and time dependent parts. Superposition is fully taken into account within the single integral formulation used. Specific formulations based on power law time dependence and truncated expansions are developed. These are appropriate for weak stress and strain dependence. The interrelated constitutive formulation is applied to ligaments, in which stiffness increases with strain, stress relaxation proceeds faster than creep, and rate of creep is a function of stress and rate of relaxation is a function of strain. An interrelation was also constructed for commercial diecast aluminum alloy currently used in small engine applications"

			Abstract="Bone and tendon are complex hierarchical structures which are interconnected to fulfill their biomechanical function. In tendon, filamentous collagen fibrils, which make up collagen fibers, are the main structural elements. In bone, the basic building blocks are collagen fibrils and crystals of carbonate apatite. Three papers are discussed in this section. The first paper describes the molecular and supramolecular steps associated with collagen self-assembly and tendon development, and analyzes how these steps relate to the ability of tendons to store energy elastically. In the second paper, the authors formulate a model to examine the effect of collagen fibril length on the mechanical properties of tendon. For the assumed mode of interfibrillar stress transfer, results show that mechanical properties of tendon are directly proportional to fibril length, diameter, and modulus, and inversely proportional to interfibrillar spacing. In the third paper, the authors use procollagen and collagen molecules as a liquid crystal and observe its spontaneous assembly using optical microscopy/TEM and showed that this in vitro self-assembly mimics the morphogenesis of dense collagen matrices associated with compact bone. They obtain characteristic collagen morphologies including crimp (associated with tendons) and an arced pattern (similar to architectures in compact bone). Together, these papers elucidate fundamentals of collagen relevant to fibrillogenesis and osteogenesis"

			Abstract="The goal of this study was to determine the duration of time that ligaments from a study group need to be loaded in order to adequately determine their collective viscoelastic behavior. Rat ligaments were subjected either to creep or stress relaxation for 1,000 s or stress relaxation for 10,000 s to compare estimates of viscoelastic behavior for different test durations. Stresses versus time (relaxation) or strains versus time (creep) were fit with power law models (t&#x26;beta; where &#x26;beta; is the rate of creep or relaxation on a log-log scale). Time intervals were separated by logarithmic decade and analyzed using a random coefficients approach to compute residual specimen error as a function of the number of decades of data analyzed. Standard regression was also used for comparison. Results show that by testing for &#x26;les; 100 s (i.e. two logarithmic decades of time) offers 1% less accuracy than testing for 1,000 seconds (i.e. three decades) when estimating the viscoelastic behavior of a specimen. These 100 s power law estimates are far more accurate than the between specimen dispersion of viscoelastic properties. Hence, a better way to compare viscoelastic behavior between study groups is to test more specimens for shorter durations. This reduces experimental time per sample and therefore increases efficiency"

			Abstract="This study shows how a probabilistic microstructural model for fibrous connective tissue behavior can be used to objectively describe soft tissue low-load behavior. More specifically, methods to determine tissue reference length and the transition from the strain-stiffening &#x22;toe-region&#x22; to the more linear region of the stress-strain curve of fibrous connective tissues are presented. According to a microstructural model for uniaxially loaded collagenous tissues, increasingly more fibers are recruited and bear load with increased tissue elongation. Fiber recruitment is represented statistically according to a Weibull probability density function (PDF). The Weibull PDF location parameter in this formulation corresponds to the stretch at which the first fibers begin to bear load and provides a convenient method of determining reference length. The toe-to-linear region transition is defined by utilizing the Weibull cumulative distribution function (CDF) which relates the fraction of loaded fibers to the tissue elongation. These techniques are illustrated using representative tendon and ligament data from the literature, and are shown to be applicable retrospectively to data from specimens that are not heavily preloaded. The reference length resulting from this technique provides an objective datum from which to calculate stretch, strain, and tangent modulus, while the Weibull CDF provides an objective parameter with which to characterize the limits of low-load behavior"

			Abstract="Reconstructive microsurgery is performed to reattach, transfer, or transplant body tissues. Venous congestion is a complication that threatens the viability of the affected tissue and is often treated with medicinal leeches. Leech therapy has two phases: active bloodletting and passive bleeding from the leech wound after detachment, which can last for several hours. Unfortunately, the small blood volumes removed by medicinal leeches are generally ineffective in decongesting tissue. Our goal was to develop a device to augment blood removal during the passive-bleeding phase of leech therapy with the use of a porcine model of venous congestion. Results indicated that the use of the device resulted in significant increases in blood retrieval relative to reports of passive bleeding alone (141%, 156%, and 155% in 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively). These results are an encouraging first step toward development of a mechanical device that completely replaces the use of medicinal leeches in modern medicine."

			Abstract="An attempt was made to consider two viscoelastic properties: the increase in tissue deformation over time with a constant load (creep) and the decrease in load with time at a constant tissue elongation (stress relaxation). The hypothesis was that nonlinear viscoelasticity of ligament requires a description more general than the separable quasilinear viscoeleasticity (QLV) formulation commonly used. This hypothesis was tested via creep and relaxation experiments performed at multiple levels in the physiologic region of recoverable loading."

			Abstract="This study used radiography, gait analysis, gluteal muscle mass, mechanical testing, and qualitative histology to compare three methods of gluteal muscle attachment to an allograft/endoprosthetic composite of the proximal 25% of the femur in an in vivo canine model. The three methods of gluteal muscle attachment were identical to those used clinically in human patients for hip revision and proximal femoral limb salvage: the host gluteal tendon sutured to the allograft tendon (tendon group), the host greater trochanter with intact gluteal tendons secured to the allograft with a cable-grip system (grip group), and periosteally vascularized proximal femoral bone onlay with intact tendons wrapped around the allograft (wrap group). On the basis of radiographs taken every 2 months, the tendon group had more graft fractures than did the grip or wrap group. Radiographic union of the graft-host bone junction occurred more rapidly and there was less graft resorption in the wrap group than in the other two groups. In all dogs, peak vertical ground-reaction forces in the treated limb decreased immediately after surgery and then slowly increased over the length of the study. The dogs in the wrap group regained normal weight-hearing on the treated limb more quickly than did those in the other groups. The constructs in the tendon group were weaker and less stiff immediately after surgery than were those in the other groups or in intact controls. Histologic analysis confirmed that the wrap technique resulted in complete union of the host bone-allograft junction more often than did the other techniques. The wrap method had the best functional outcome after 9 months when an allograft/endoprosthetic composite was used during total hip arthroplasty in this canine model."

			Abstract="The goal of this study was to expand understanding of strain-generated potential (SGP) in ligamentous or tendinous tissues. Most SGP studies in the past have focused on cartilage or bone. Herein, rabbit patellar tendon (PT) was used as a model. Each patellar tendon had two Ag/AgCl electrodes inserted at axial positions of 1/4 and 1/2 from patellar to tibial insertions. Each specimen was electrically isolated, gripped in a servohydraulic test system, and then subjected to a short session of uniaxial haversine tension (2.5 percent maximum strain) at a frequency of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 5.0 Hz. A cyclic (sinusoidal) electrical potential superimposed upon a larger transient (exponentially asymptotic) potential was consistently observed. Upon termination of loading, the cyclic SGP ended, and the shifted baseline of the SGP exponentially decayed and asymptotically returned to a residual potential which over all specimens was not different than the original potential. The transient and cyclic SGPs were frequency dependent (P33, pp. 289-304) and Chen (1996, Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison) has not been observed in other experiments using different protocols. Additional PTs were dehydrated and the rehydrated in solution at different pH levels. The magnitude of SGPs increased in basic solution (pH 9.5) but diminished in pH 4.7 buffer. This pH dependency suggests that electrokinetics is the dominant mechanism for the transient and cyclic responses of the SGPs, although this study does not provide direct evidence"

			Abstract="Treatment of defects in articular cartilage is complicated by its limited spontaneous repair capacity. New approaches to treatment involve inducing healing with cells or growth factors. The effectiveness of these strategies requires delivery, spatial and temporal stability, as well as local biochemical and biologic effects. The authors have developed novel biomaterials based on hyaluronic acid for local delivery of cells and bioactive factors, with unique physical and biologic properties. These materials have been shown to induce ectopic chondrogenesis in a rat model. The biomechanical properties of these materials are evaluated, demonstrating confined compression behavior similar to cartilage. Hyaluronic acid hydrogel filled collagen sponge composites are promising materials with bioactive potential for repair of articular cartilage and the biomechanical ability to maintain spatial and temporal control during healing"

			Abstract="An impulse-momentum exercise system was instrumented for collection of kinematic and kinetic data during shoulder exercise. The objective of this study was to quantify the dynamics of an exercise system that utilizes a weighted shuttle (22.2 N) traveling on a rail system and evaluate its efficacy as an exercise and rehabilitative tool. Two healthy adults (mean age, 30.0 years) were tested utilizing 2 protocols. The first protocol required the subject to maintain tension in the system while externally rotating the upper arm from neutral at 90&#x26;deg; relative to the shoulder and then internally rotating back to the initial position. In the second protocol, the range of motion was similar, but each subject was instructed to carry out the exercise as rapidly as possible without regard to the tension in the rope, thus creating an impulsive load. Average peak loads up to 87.9 and 137.0 N were recorded using the first and second protocols, respectively. Average maximum loads using the second protocol were approximately 50 N greater than those using the first protocol (p 2, protocol 1 vs. protocol 2, respectively)."

			Abstract="Experimental data show that relaxation proceeds more rapidly (a greater slope on a log-log scale) than creep in ligament, a fact not explained by linear viscoelasticity. An interrelation between creep and relaxation is therefore developed for ligaments based on a single-integral nonlinear superposition model. This interrelation differs from the convolution relation obtained by Laplace transforms for linear materials. We demonstrate via continuum concepts of nonlinear viscoelasticity that such a difference in rate between creep and relaxation phenomenologically occurs when the nonlinearity is of a strain-stiffening type, i.e., the stress-strain curve is concave up as observed in ligament. We also show that it is inconsistent to assume a Fung-type constitutive law (Fung, 1972) for both creep and relaxation. Using the published data of Thornton et al. (1997), the nonlinear interrelation developed herein predicts creep behavior from relaxation data well (R greater than or equal 0.998). Although data are limited and the causal mechanisms associated with viscoelastic tissue behavior are complex, continuum concepts demonstrated here appear capable of interrelating creep and relaxation with fidelity."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study was to investigate the microstructure and collagen organization in the transition region between scar and normal tissues of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in a rat model using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transition region microscopy consistently demonstrated continuity of collagen fibers and fibrils from the residual portions of the transected ligament through the scar region. Bifurcations/fusions, but no anastomosis, in fibers and fibrils were observed in both normal and scar tissues. In the scar region larger diameter fibers of the normal tissue bifurcated into smaller diameter fibrils in the scar region. This connection between larger diameter and smaller diameter tissues indicates that bifurcations/fusion are likely to be the dominant way in which force is transmitted in the healing ligament."

			Abstract="This study developed a three-dimensional biomechanical model to investigate the internal loads on the human neck that result from isometrically generated loads resisted by a force on the head. The first goal was to apply the double-optimization (DOPT) method, the EMG-based method, and the EMG assisted optimization (EMGAO) method to the neck model, calculating muscle forces and C4/5 cervical joint loads for each method. The second goal was to compare the results of the different methods, and the third was to determine maximum exertion forces in the cervical spine for isometric contractions. To formulate the EMG-based model, electromyographic signals were collected from 10 male subjects. EMG signals were obtained from 8 sites around the C4/5 level of the neck by surface electrodes, while the subject performed near maximum, isometric exertions. The mean maximum values (&#x26;plusmn;SD) calculated for C4/5 joint compressive forces during peak exertions were 1654 (&#x26;plusmn;308) N in flexion by the EMG method, 1674 (&#x26;plusmn;319) N in flexion by the EMGAO method, and 1208 (&#x26;plusmn;123) N in extension by the DOPT method. In contrast to the DOPT method, the EMG and EMGAO methods showed activation of all the muscles, including the antagonists, and accommodated various load distribution patterns among the agonist muscles during generation of the same magnitude of moments, especially in lateral bending. The EMG and EMGAO methods predicted higher cervical spinal loads than previously published results by the DOPT method. These results may be helpful to engineers and surgeons who are designing and using cervical spine implants and instrumentation."

			Abstract="Collagen fibrils in ligaments and tendons are highly organized into parallel arrays which influence interstitial fluid transport. Finite element (FE) models were developed analogous to the fibrillar arrays in ligaments and tendons to investigate interstitial fluid flow and tissue permeability as a function of interfibrillar spacing and fluid properties. Collagen fibrils were assumed to be a periodic square array of impermeable cylinders. A two-dimensional FE model was used to study transverse fluid flow and a three-dimensional model was used to study flow parallel to the collagen fibrils. Parametric FE analysis provided data to formulate empirical expressions for permeability (&#x26;kappa;) as a function of porosity (&#x26;phi;). Results show that longitudinal permeability (&#x26;kappa;=1.1&#x26;middot;10-15&#x26;phi;2.5[1-&#x26;phi;]-0.333) can be up to 50 times higher than transverse permeability (&#x26;kappa;=1.2&#x26;middot;10-15&#x26;phi;0 5[&#x26;phi;-&#x26;phi;min]2.5) in a compact array. Maximum fluid shear stresses occur at the narrowest zones of adjacent fibrils (1.21 Pa or 12.1 dyn/cm2 at 10 &#x26;mu;m/s of average transverse influx). If interstitial fluid is highly non-Newtonian, the permeability should be considered as flow (shear)-dependent. The computational results suggest that tissue permeability in ligaments and tendons is highly anisotropic, porosity-dependent, and can be estimated by analytic expressions"

			Abstract="The purpose of this study is to describe interstitial fluid flow in axisymmetric soft connective tissue (ligaments or tendons) when they are loaded in tension. Soft hydrated tissue was modelled as a porous medium (using Darcy&#x27;s Law), and the finite element method was used to solve the resulting equations governing fluid flow. A commercially available computer program (FiDAP) was used to create an axisymmetric model of a biomechanically tested rat ligament. The unknown variables at element nodes were pressure and velocity of the interstitial fluid (Newtonian and incompressible). The effect of variations in fluid viscosity and permeability of the solid matrix was parametrically explored. A transient loading state mimicking a rat ligament mechanical experiment was used in all simulations. The magnitude and distribution of pressure, stream lines, shear (stress) rate, vorticity and velocity showed regular patterns consistent with extension flow. Parametric changes of permeability and viscosity strongly affected fluid flow behaviour. When the radial permeability was 1000 times less than the axial permeability, shear rate and vorticity increased (approximately 5-fold). These effects (especially shear stress and pressure) suggested a strong interaction with the solid matrix. Computed levels of fluid flow suggested a possible load transduction mechanism for cells in the tissue."

			Abstract="Authors propose a mechanical model for tendon or ligament stress-stretch behavior that includes both microstructural and tissue level aspects of the structural hierarchy in its formulation. At the microstructural scale, a constitutive law for collagen fibers is derived based on a strain-energy formulation. The three-dimensional orientation and deformation of the collagen fibrils that aggregate to form fibers are taken into consideration. At the tissue level, an average stress versus stretch relation is computed by assuming a statistical distribution for fiber straightening during tissue loading."

			Abstract="A new system which incorporates minimally invasive physiologic methods to create a standardized, partial muscle stretch injury is described. Joint isometric torque is evaluated as a noninvasive measure of muscle damage. The main advantage of the methods is the ability to create minimally-invasive injury through a more physiologic manner, thereby more closely mimicking injuries seen clinically. The system provides accurate control of muscle activation, muscle-tendon length, joint kinematics and level of damage produced."

			Abstract="A load-threshold independent method is introduced for determining the reference length of fibrous uniaxially loaded tissues such as tendons and ligaments. In these tissues, fibers are recruited and bear load as deformation increases, and this recruitment is modeled by a Weibull probability distribution function (PDF). The method works for both initially slack and preloaded specimens and provides a method for reducing the errors that are associated with a load-threshold based determination of reference length."

			Abstract="Thermographic strain analysis (TSA) was used to measure the surface strain distribution of cyclically loaded canine femora. Eleven canine femora were cyclically loaded at 20 Hz in compression at 600 N (&#x26;plusmn200 N). After calibration with measured local strain data, it was possible to quantify the full field patterns measured from the proximal, anterior and medial cortex. The average of each TSA signal normalized by the coincident strain data (0.996) was very near to 1.0 (p = 0.999). The thermographical scans iterate the maximum compressive strains carried by the femur within the region just distal to the femoral neck. Further understanding of the strain distribution in this region is critical in the design of components that attempt to mimic anatomical load transfer after total hip arthroplasty. TSA appears to offer a promising technology as a full field experimental strain analysis method for use with biomechanical issues."

			Abstract="A system was refined for the determination of the bulk ultrasonic wave propagation velocity in small cortical bone specimens. Longitudinal and shear wave propagations were measured using ceramic, piezoelectric 20 and 5 MHz transducers, respectively. Results of the pulse transmission technique were refined via the measurement of the system delay time. The precision and accuracy of the system were quantified using small specimens of polyoxymethylene, polystyrene-butadiene, and high-density polyethylene. These polymeric materials had known acoustic properties similarity of propagation velocities to cortical bone, and minimal sample inhomogeneity. Dependence of longitudinal and transverse specimen dimensions upon propagation times was quantified. To confirm the consistency of longitudinal wave propagation in small cortical bone specimens (ii), shear moduli (Gij), and Poisson ratios (&#x26;nu;ij) were measured. For all specimens (bone, polyoxymethylene, polystyrene-butadiene, and high-density polyethylene), strong linear correlations (R2gt;0.997) were maintained between propagation time and distance throughout the size ranges down to less than 0.4 mm. Results for polyoxymethylene, polystyrene-butadiene, and high-density polyethylene were accurate to within 5 percent of reported literature values. Measurement repeatability (precision) improved with an increase in the wave transmission distance (propagating dimension). No statistically significant effect due to the transverse dimension was detected."

			Abstract="A refinement of the current ultrasonic elasticity technique was used to measure the orthotropic elastic properties of rat cortical bone as well as to quantify changes in elastic properties, density, and porosity of the dwarf rat cortex after a treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). The ultrasonic elasticity technique was refined via optimized signal management of high-frequency wave propagation through cubic cortical specimens. Twenty dwarf rats (37 days old) were randomly assigned to two groups (10 rats each). The dwarf rat model (5-10% of normal GH) was given subcutaneous injections of either rhGH or saline over a 14-day treatment period. Density was measured using Archimedes&#x27; technique. Porosity and other microstructural characteristics were also explored via scanning electron microscopy and image analysis. Statistical tests verified significant decreases in cortical orthotropic Young&#x27;s (-26.7%) and shear (-16.7%) moduli and density (-2.42%) concomitant with an increase in porosity (+125%) after rhGH treatments to the dwarf model (p&#x3c;0.05). A change in material symmetry from orthotropy toward planar isotropy within the radial-circumferential plane after GH treatments was also noted. These results demonstrate some alteration in bone properties at this time interval. Structural implications of these changes throughout physiological loading regimens should be explored."

			Abstract="A study was conducted to determine the effect of fusion on the tensile load relaxation and strength of juxtafused discs 3 months postoperatively. Intact lumber L3-L4 and L5-L6 intervertebral discs were harvested from mature alpine goats. Specimens were placed into serrated grips mounted to a materials testing machine. The loading protocol for each specimen consisted of (1) preconditioning cyclic loading, (2) a load relaxation test, and (3) quasistatic loading in tension to failure. Specimens were wetted throughout preparation and testing with a 14% aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol to prevent dehydration or swelling.

			Abstract="This study quantified the orthotropic elastic changes in cortical bone due to aging as well as determined any elastic changes after acute treatments of growth hormone (GH). Three groups of twenty rats represented three age groups of young adult (9 months), middle age (20 months), and old (31 months) rats. During a ten day period half of the rats in each age group were given twice-daily doses of recombinant human GH while the remaining half were injected with a vehicle control (saline). The effects of aging and GH on the elastic characteristics of cortical bone were quantified via ultrasonic wave propagation. Propagation velocities of longitudinal and shear waves were measured through cubic cortical specimens from the posterior femoral diaphysis. Density was measured by Archimedes&#x27; technique. The normalized, orthotropic elastic properties of Young&#x27;s moduli (Eii), shear moduli (Gij), and Poisson&#x27;s ratios (&#x26;nu;ij) were calculated and used to compare the groups (where i and j=1, 2, or 3 reference the radial, circumferential, and longitudinal axes, respectively). Cortical elastic moduli consistently increased with age with the strongest effects demonstrated in radial dependent properties such as E11 (+25.3% from 9 to 31 months, p=0.0004) and G12 (+12.6% from 20 to 31 months, p=0.0419). The ratio of transverse to axial displacement (Poisson&#x27;s ratio) typically decreased with age (9 to 31 months) as seen in &#x26;nu;31 (-24.95%, p=0.0134) and &#x26;nu;32 (-20.7%, p=00015). Overall, a ten day treatment with GH produced no global statistical change in elastic properties (p&#x3e;0.05). However, GH did minimize the age related differences that were measured for E22, E33, and &#x26;nu;32 between the 9 and 31 month old groups essentially returning old bone to its youthful elastic state. These finding add orthotropic detail to the current understanding of changing cortical elastic properties during aging as well as providing a reference for further studies of GH"

			Abstract="The relative linear and angular displacements of proximal femoral reconstructions were compared within six different replacement techniques during ex vivo axial compression, mediolateral bending, and axial torsion in dogs. Each femur was osteotomized at 25%, 50%, or 75% of its length and the proximal portion subsequently replaced using one of six techniques. The reconstruction techniques included various combinations of proximal and distal fixation methods (graft fixation/distal fixation): (1) an allograft/prosthesis composite (APC) press-fit proximally and cemented distally (press-fit/cement); (2) APC cemented proximally and distally (cement/cement); (3) APC cemented proximally and the host bone/graft interface double plated (cement/plates); (4) APC cemented proximally and secured distally with bicortical screws (cement/screws); (5) APC secured proximally and distally with bicortical screws (screws/screws); (6) Segmental proximal femoral replacement cemented into the distal femur without an allograft (no graft/cement). For axial compression and mediolateral bending, the combined resection lengths revealed no differences in linear and angular displacements, respectively, between reconstruction methods. During axial torsion, the cement/cement technique allowed larger angular displacements than all but the press-fit/cement technique which had larger displacements than the cement/screws, screws/screws, and no graft/cement groups (p &#x3c; 0.0001). Overall, the measured implant stability was solid and consistent as evidenced by small amounts of relative displacement and small error values."

			Abstract="A mathematical model has been developed for stress-stretch behavior with parameters directly related to structural and microstructural features of the tissue. The model is capable of representing the complete quasistatic response including toe-in, linear region, and damage/failure. The model is useful not only in characterizing tissue response, but also in predicting material properties based on collagen structural and microstructural features. The model can be used to determine which aspects of collagen structure and microstructure are of the greatest mechanical importance for tissue healing and tissue engineering applications."

			Abstract="Recent scientific studies evaluating laser energy for tissue welding and thermokeratoplasty have demonstrated that the application of laser energy at non-ablative levels can alter collagen&#x27;s structural and biochemical properties. A recent pilot study has demonstrated that the non-ablative application of holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser energy to the joint capsule of patients with glenohumeral instability shrank the joint capsule, stabilizing the shoulder in the majority of the patients treated. Based on the collective findings of these studies, we hypothesized that thermal modification of dense collagenous tissues such as joint capsule, ligament, and tendon can be achieved by applying non-ablative laser energy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of laser energy at non-ablative levels on joint capsular mechanical, biochemical, histological, and ultrastructural properties in an in vitro rabbit model."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study was to investigate the waveform and frequency dependence of strain generated potentials (SGP) in the patellar tendon (PT). Eight PTs from adult, female New Zealand rabbits were harvested with patellar and tibial attachments immediately after death. Bone blocks were glued into brass tubes and then gripped in an MTS materials testing machine. Three Ag/AgCl electrodes were made and inserted into the cross sectional centers of each PT at axial positions 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 from the patella to the tibia respectively. Under displacement control, the PT was loaded to 0.5 mm of grip to grip stretch using 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 Hz sinusoidal waveforms. The SGP baseline reached a plateau value (steady state) and exponentially decayed to the original value after removing the loads. Plateaus of SGP varied linearly with the frequency changes. Phase shifts were observed with changes in frequency. Significant differences in the SGP plateau were found for all examined frequencies except between 1.0 Hz and 2.0 Hz. The plateau value implies that high potentials in the PTs are generated after exercises that includes repeated high frequency loadings. These potentials may in turn affect cell regulation"

			Abstract="Interstitial fluid flow in ligaments and tendons in response to loading is not only important for mechanical behavior and nutrition but also as a signalling mechanism for tissue maintenance and adaptation. The objective of this study is to examine fluid transport in ligament in response to load. Fluid transport in six medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) dissected from retired breeder rats is examined by measuring the volumetric changes with loading. The volume of MCL decreased with loading, suggesting that fluid is exuded from the tissue. Although there are limitations to the accuracy of the volume calculations, results indicate that there is a fluid transport mechanism in the tissue that may be important for mechanical behavior, nutrition and for cell response to loading."

			Abstract="This paper presents what may be the first experimental quantification of muscle effect on spine motion and stability in vivo, and provides a basis for validation of both ex vivo and analytical models. The in vivo monitoring system used has allowed the quantification of intervertebral motion (in goat specimens) with and without muscle activity and thereby the determination of the relative contribution of muscle to the control of spine motion in extension. It is found that although posterior ligamentous destabilizing procedures increase motion, muscle action is capable of maintaining spinal stability. Muscle action in the active spinal system is important in providing stability and a protective &#x27;cushion&#x27; for passive osteoligamentous spinal structures."

			Abstract="A previous study have shown that the strain generated potential (SGP) in rabbit patellar tendon (PT) is frequency and pH dependent. The present study attempts to relate changes in internal hydraulic pressure to the electrokinetics of PT. Eight PTs from adult New Zealand rabbits with patellar and tibial bone block were harvested immediately after death. Bone blocks were cross-sectioned, then Ag/AgCl electrodes with barb were inserted into the cross sectional centers of each PT. Prior to testing, the PT was moistened in balanced saline for 20-40 minutes until the signal stabilized. Results obtained indicate that both hydraulic pressure and SGPs respond to cyclic tension and also support an electrokinetic theory for this behavior."

			Abstract="Fibrils of fiber-forming collagen are helices of microfibrils which are in turn five strands of collagen molecules characteristically assembled in quarter-staggered alignments. The goal of this study was to investigate how cross-linking and other types of intermolecular bonding affect the mechanical behavior of these fibrils. The finite-element method was used to model the quarter-staggered nanostructure in two dimensions and simulate its mechanical response to applied loadings. Stable cross-links were assumed to be randomly distributed at the available sites on the collagen molecules with a prescribed probability, and the Monte Carlo technique was used to determine their mechanical consequences. Besides stable cross-links, the effects of other intermolecular bonds (reducible cross-links and weak forces) were included in the model. Relative constitutive behaviors of collagen and intermolecular bonds were parametrically examined. Computational results from the Monte Carlo simulations were plotted to show the (dimensionless) stiffness of collagen fibrils as a function of cross-link concentration and normalized stiffness of the various intermolecular bonds. These plots were used to interpret model results with respect to reported experimental behaviors for ligaments, tendons, and bones. Results show that stable cross-links in physiologic concentrations, when considered by themselves, are insufficient to structurally stabilize the collagen fibril. Other intermolecular interactions (such as reducible cross-links, weak forces, disulfidebonds, or cross-links yet to be identified) must then play an important or even dominant role in the internal distribution and transmission of force within the collagen fibril. The model also predicts that there is a critical threshold for intermolecular bonding"

			Abstract="This study compared three methods of gluteus medius tendon attachment to an allograft/endoprosthetic composite of the proximal 25% of the femur in a canine model. The three methods were bone to bone, tendon to bone, and tendon to tendon. There were no significant differences in tensile strength among the three types of attachment. The tensile stiffness of the bone to bone attachments (91.0% of the controls) was significantly greater than that of the tendon to bone attachments (40.8% of the controls) but not significantly different from that of the tendon to tendon attachments (63.2% of the controls). The bone to bone attachment was associated with increased bone resorption, bone remodeling, and bone porosity, accompanied by thinner allograft cortices, when compared with the other types of attachment. In dogs with a bone to bone attachment, weight-bearing increased more slowly than in dogs with either of the other two attachments. These changes associated with the bone to bone attachment may merely be secondary to healing of the bone to bone attachment to the greater trochanter; therefore, they may only be temporary phenomena or they may be the portents for long-term complications. Longer term studies of at least 1-2 years must be performed before these questions can be answered."

			Abstract="This study was designed to compare the biomechanical and functional characteristics of allograft/endoprosthetic composites of the proximal 25% of the femur repaired with either a transverse or a step-cut osteotomy, using a canine model (10 dogs, five with each type of osteotomy). Serial radiography and weight-bearing studies were performed monthly, and mechanical testing was done 6 months after surgery. The femora were tested in torsion and compared with the contralateral control (insertion of a femoral component but no osteotomy). At 6 months, the composites with a step-cut osteotomy had 36% greater structural stiffness than the composites with a transverse osteotomy (p &#x3c; 0.005) and 121% greater maximum torque at failure than the controls (p &#x3c; 0.005), without greater structural stiffness. Evaluation of peak vertical ground reaction forces revealed significantly greater weight-bearing on the experimental limb in dogs with a transverse osteotomy. The results of this relatively short-term study were mixed. Despite the increased structural stiffness of the allograft/endoprosthetic composite with a step-cut osteotomy, the dogs with this type of reconstruction had decreased weight-bearing throughout the course of the study. The step-cut osteotomy may augment the stability of the allograft/endoprosthetic composite, allowing faster healing (as demonstrated by the results of mechanical testing), but in some way, not understood, may cause pain in the reconstructed limb. Longer term studies are needed to answer these questions and to determine whether alteration of the traditional transverse osteotomy has any advantage."

			Abstract="A mathematical model was developed for tendon and ligament mechanical response incorporating both structural and microstructural features. At the structural scale, crimp in the collagen fascicles is modeled by a probability distribution function for straightening strain. At the microstructural scale, a strain energy approach is used to develop a constitutive law for fascicles. This model allows investigation of how changes in collagen microstructural and structural organization affected tissue response."

			Abstract="Effects of canine hip replacement (with a porous-coated femoral component) on the material properties of surrounding cortical bone were evaluated. The hypotheses were: (1) after four months of implantation, mechanical properties of the cortex would change, and (2) a collared implant would be associated with smaller changes than a collarless design. Unilateral total hip arthroplasty was performed in 15 mixed-breed dogs."

			Abstract="Finite element heat-transfer models of ferromagnetic thermoseeds and catheters are developed for simulating ferromagnetic hyperthermia. These models are implemented into a general purpose, finite element computer program to solve the bioheat transfer equation. The seed and catheter models are unique in that they have fewer modeling constraints than other previously developed thermal models. Simulations are conducted with a 4 &#x26;times; 4 array of seeds in a multicompartment tissue model. The heat transfer model predicts that fractions of tumor greater than 43&#x26;deg;C are between 8 and 40% lower when seed temperatures depend on power versus models which assume a constant seed temperature. Fractions of tumor greater than 42&#x26;deg;C, in simulations using seed and catheter models, are between 3.3 and 25% lower than in simulations with bare seeds. It is demonstrated that an array of seeds with Curie points of 62.6&#x26;deg;C heats the tumor very well over nearly all blood perfusion cases studied. In summary, results herein suggest that thermal models simulating ferromagnetic hyperthermia should consider the power-temperature dependence of seeds and include explicit models of catheters."

			Abstract="The structural stiffness and the stiffness of the osteotomy site after six types of reconstruction of the proximal femur were compared by testing in axial compression, mediolateral bending, and axial torsion in a canine model. An osteotomy was carried out for 25, 50, or 75% of the length of each femur, and the proximal portion was replaced by one of five allograft/endoprosthetic composites or a segmental replacement. The reconstructions included (a) a composite press-fit proximally and cemented distally, (b) a composite cemented proximally and distally, (c) a composite cemented proximally and fixed with two plates at the allograft-host bone interface, (d) a composite cemented proximally and secured distally with bicortical screws, (e) a composite secured proximally and distally with bicortical screws, and (f) a segmental prosthesis cemented into the distal femur. The results showed that the segmental reconstruction and the reconstruction with double-plate fixation and a cemented endoprosthesis were structurally stiffer and had greater stiffness of the osteotomy site than the other reconstructions. In comparison, reconstructions that involved cement alone or cement and press-fit techniques generally were more compliant than the others, both structurally and at the osteotomy site."

			Abstract="Finite-element solutions to the Pennes bioheat equation are obtained with a model of a tumour-containing, human prostate and surrounding normal tissues. Simulations of ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatments are conducted on the tissue model in which the prostate is implanted with an irregularly spaced array of thermoseeds. Several combinations of thermoseed temperatures with different Curie points are investigated. Nonuniform, constant-rate blood perfusion models are studied and compared with temperature-dependent descriptions of blood perfusion. Blood perfusions in the temperature-dependent models initially increase with tissue temperature and then decrease at higher temperatures. Simulations with temperature-dependent versus constant-rate blood perfusion models reveal significant differences in temperature distributions in and surrounding the tumour-containing prostate. Results from the simulations include differences (between temperature-dependent and constant-rate models) in (1) the percentage of normal tissue volume and tumour volume at temperatures &#x3e;42&#x26;deg;C, and (2) temperature descriptors in the tumour (subscript t) and normal (subscript n) tissues including Tmax,t, Tmin,t and Tmax,n. Isotherms and grey-scale contours in the tumour and surrounding normal tissues are presented for 4 simulations that model a combination of high-temperature thermoseeds. Several simulations show that Tmin,t is between 1.7 and 2.6&#x26;deg;C higher and Tmax,n is between 2.1 and 3.3&#x26;deg;C higher with a temperature-dependent versus a comparable constant-rate blood perfusion model. The same simulations reveal that the percentages of tumour volume at temperatures &#x3e;42&#x26;deg;C are between 0 and 68% higher with the temperature-dependent versus the constant-rate perfusion model over all seed combinations studied"

			Abstract="Increases in compartment pressure associated with chronic compartment syndrome (CCS) may be due to changes in the mechanical properties and/or thickness of fascia. To explore this possibility, the authors compared the mechanical and biochemical characteristics (stiffness, thickness, time-dependent response, collagen content, and collagen crosslinking) of fascia from patients with symptomatic anterior compartment syndrome to fascia from adjacent collateral compartments. The authors tested 43 specimens harvested from 20 individuals during surgical fasciectomy. Properties of normal (lateral)-compartment (NC) and pathological (anterior)-compartment (PC) fascia were mechanically tested in the axial and transverse directions forming 4 groups. An external control group (EX) of 6 specimens of anterior and lateral-compartment fascia harvested from amputated legs was also included in the study. PC fascia was found to be thicker and structurally stiffer (elastic modulus times thickness) in the axial direction than was NC fascia (p&#x26;les;0.05). No significant differences were found between NC and PC time-dependent response, although significant differences between percent relaxation in the pooled axial and transverse direction specimens were observed. No differences were found in the collagen content, as measured by hydroxyproline (Hyp) concentration, between NC and PC fascia. PC fascia was found to have less collagen crosslinking by hydroxylyslpyridinoline (HP) concentration. In conclusion, although this study does not elucidate etiological factors in CCS, the changes found in PC fascia suggest that fascial mechanical properties contribute to the pathology"

			Abstract="The paper examines bone-to-implant relative displacements of acetabular prostheses acutely and after ingrowth in a canine model. Uncemented hemispherical acetabular cups with titanium mesh pads comprising approximately 26% of the surface of the cup were inserted in eight adult canine hemipelves. A load simulating 1,000 cycles of canine gait was applied to the acetabular component, and relative displacements were measured at three locations between implant and bone to determine acute fixation. The relative displacements of these implants were small in all cases and did not correlate with the amount of bone ingrowth. These data suggest that fixation with two screws can lead to bone ingrowth and reduced motion of the prosthesis under functional loading."

			Abstract="A system is described that allows axial, torsional, and bending testing of biomechanical specimens. The system uses electric motors under closed loop control in its grips allowing application of pure bending moments. These grips attach to an axial/torsional testing system. Thus, it provides simultaneous closed loop control of all three degrees of freedom (D.O.F), so that under any given test condition either the loads or the displacements for each D.O.F. can be maintained at zero, selected constant values, or simultaneously controlled. This enables the expedient evaluation of the mechanical behavior of biological structures under complex loadings or simple loadings (one D.O.F.) with no artificially induced constraints in the other two D.O.F.&#x27;s due to specimen mounting."

Tissue culture allows for excellent control of applied loads and it maintains cells in their extracellular matrix. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cyclic loading on canine anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in culture by measuring tissue stiffness, collagen biochemistry, and histology. The mechanical stimulus used in this experiment did not produce measurable differences between loaded and unloaded specimens. However, loading did maintain the organization of the ECM and appearance of the cells."

			Abstract="Seven techniques of gluteus medius attachment were compared in vitro in a canine model. Four methods were used for tendon to tendon attachment: (a) two modified Bunnell-Mayer sutures, (b) two Kessler locking loop sutures, (c) two horizontal mattress sutures, and (d) two sutures with a looped suture technique. The two methods of tendon to bone attachment were repair with a 1 cm spiked staple and repair with a spiked washer and screw, and the method of bone to bone attachment involved two figure-eight cerclage wires. The contralateral limb served as a control. Compared with the bone to bone attachment, the four tendon to tendon attachments and the two tendon to bone attachments had significantly less strength (31 and 30% of the ultimate load for bone to bone repair, respectively) and tensile stiffness (24 and 39% of the tensile stiffness for bone to bone attachment, respectively) (p&#x3c;0.0001). The control specimens were significantly stronger and stiffer than all specimens (p&#x3c;0.05) except those that had bone to bone fixation. There were no significant differences among the four tendon to tendon suture repairs with regard to either strength or stiffness; the values ranged from 28-45% of those of the controls. Among the tendon to bone repairs, fixation with a spiked washer and screw was significantly stronger than that with a spiked staple (p = 0.032), but there was no difference between these two techniques with regard to stiffness."

			Abstract="A mechanical study was performed to ascertain if a stainless steel wire rope can be used as the transosseous component in an external fracture fixator for large animal veterinary applications. A large preload in the wire rope is necessary to obtain a functional stiffness for fracture fixation. Therefore, a method was sought for terminating the wire rope so that an appropriate preload could be introduced into the rope through its interface with the fixator ring. Ropes were terminated with 5 different methods and tested in axial tension to failure. Using the strongest termination method, a single rope was assembled with the fixator ring and loaded in 4 point bending, and transverse displacements of the rope were measured as a function of the applied load. The maximum displacements of the rope were approximately 4 mm at loads of nearly 1900 N. When coupled with acceptable levels of fracture site displacements, this study can provide a guideline for the maximum animal limb loading that can be supported by the fixator depending on the number of transosseous wire ropes used."

			Abstract="The structural stiffnesses of a six proximal femoral reconstruction techniques were compared during ex vivo axial compression, mediolateral bending, and axial torsion in a canine model. Each femur was osteotomized at 25%, 50%, or 75% of its length and the proximal portion subsequently replaced using one of the six techniques thus creating an allograft/prosthesis composite (APC). These reconstruction techniques included various combinations of proximal and distal fixation methods (graft fixation/distal fixation): 1) Press-fit/Cement; 2) Cement/Cement; 3) Cement/Plates; 4) Cement/Screws; 5) Screws/Screws; 6) No Graft/Cement. Axial compression demonstrated a similar structural response when comparing all the reconstruction techniques overall and for each resection length. The mediolateral bending and axial torsion load applications did reveal a difference between techniques. The Cement/ Plates and No Graft/Cement constructs had significantly larger stiffnesses than the other four groups during mediolateral bending (p = 0.0001). During axial torsion, the Cement/Plates group was more stiff than the five other constructs (p = 0.0001) while the No Graft/Cement technique had a larger resistance to torsion than the remaining four constructs (p = 0.0001)."

			Abstract="A canine hip replacement model was used to compare fixation stability in cemented and cementless femoral components. Parameters of comparison were the load-induced positional changes of each prosthesis relative to its proximal femoral cortex, hereafter called relative displacements. Identical femoral components, with the proximal third of their stem porous-coated, were implanted in the right femurs of 10 large, mixed-breed dogs. Five were tightly fit to allow porous ingrowth, and five were cemented into the medullary canal. Four months after implantation, all femurs were harvested. A prosthesis was implanted in the left (normal) femur of each dog ex vivo with fixation identical to the contralateral limb to simulate acute postoperative fixation. Eddy current transducers measured relative displacements under application of static loads, serially applied in the axial, mediolateral, and craniocaudal directions. Thereafter, the femurs were transversely sectioned and morphologically analyzed to correlate bony apposition at the implant surface with relative displacements. We observed no difference in relative displacements between acute and 4-month-cemented groups (e.g., 0.0059 &#x26;plusmn 0.0021 vs. 0.0060 &#x26;plusmn 0.0048 mm, respectively, for 100-N axial loading measured at midstem)."

			Abstract="Hip replacement in a femur with proximal bone loss was studied in a canine model. Specifically, the fixation stability of a prosthesis and proximal bone graft relative to the distal femur was analyzed. Linear and angular relative displacements of proximal femoral canine grafts were determined after four months of implantation and after ex vivo (nonresected) implantation. Relative displacements representing the six degrees of freedom were calculated via matrix transformations from the relative displacements measured by nine eddy current transducers. A comparison of the stability during axial and transverse loading between distally cemented and distally press-fit total hip reconstructions was made. The results showed no significant differences between the stability of cemented and cementless reconstructed femora during both loading orientations. The femora implanted for four months had significantly larger linear lateral displacement for cemented (p = 0.0490) and cementless (p = 0.0313) groups during axial loading compared to the nonresected femora. Transverse loading revealed no significant differences between control and four month groups."

			Abstract="Under adiabatic (or near adiabatic) conditions of volumetric change in an elastic material will produce a corresponding change in temperature. Based upon this principle, thermographic stress analysis (TSA) measures changes in surface heat flux (which are related to changes in surface temperature) and relates them to a coupled form of strains or stresses. To demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique for biomechanical applications, the authors thermographically measured heat flux from loaded specimens of cortical bone and correlated the results with strain gage data. Regular parallelepipeds were cut from the cortex of bovine femora and loaded sinusoidally at 20 Hz. At this rate of loading, mechanically induced changes in surface temperature could be sampled (via heat flux) prior to a measurable attenuation of the thermoelastic effect. Correlation coefficients demonstrated a significant linear relationship between TSA and measured and computed mechanical parameters (stress, strain, first strain invariant, and strain energy density). TSA therefore appears to be a promising technology for experimental stress analysis in cortical bone"

			Abstract="Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is an accepted surgical procedure for disc herniation or spondylosis. It is not without complications however, most commonly related to nonunion, particularly in multi-level procedures, and graft donor site morbidity. Discectomy without bone graft and the use of allograft bone have been used to eliminate donor site morbidity. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the effectiveness of three techniques; 1) discectomy without bone graft, 2) with autograft fusion, and 3) with fresh frozen allograft fusion, in an animal model. Biomechanical evaluation of post surgical stability and fusion was compared with the results of histologic and radiographic analyses. Generally autogenous graft material gave the highest fusion rate and the highest stiffness characteristics."

			Abstract="After canine hip replacement, the effects on the material properties of the collared and collarless femoral components surrounding bone were compared. Ultrasound velocites and bone mineral densities were measured and used to calculate the changes in the axial modulus of elasticity of the cortex surrounding the implant. The results showed no difference between the collared and collarless designs for the particular fiber mesh style of implant used. Significant decreases in velocities were noted after four months of implantation for both implant designs at midstem and distal locations. Bone mineral densities (using DEXA) also displayed decreased values after four months of implantation. Elasticity moduli calculated from the ultrasound velocites and DEXA densities were consistently less after four months of implantation when compared to acute implantation."

			Abstract="Primate patellar tendons were subjected to different regimens of preconditioning, regimens that could be reasonably implemented during surgery, and then held at a fixed deformation to measure viscoelastic behavior. Twenty primate patella-patellar tendon-tibia complexes were divided into four groups. Group one was cyclically preconditioned for 10 minutes, unloaded for 10 minutes, and then tested for stress relaxation. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were held at fixed displacement for 10 minutes and subsequently unloaded for 1, 10, and 30 minutes respectively before undergoing stress relaxation testing. Results showed that the percent drop-off in load was significantly less for preconditioned ligaments than for ligaments that were not conditioned. Further, the percent drop-off increased as the time between preloading and stress relaxation test increased. The fixed deformation preconditioning was found to have significantly less load drop-off than the cyclic preconditioning."

			Abstract="A two-dimensional, finite-element program has been written and a thermal model of interstitial ferromagnetic implants has been developed for optimal treatment planning of cancerous tumors with ferromagnetic hyperthermia. An iterative technique has been implemented to include the power-temperature relationship of 0.9 mm diameter, nickel-copper thermoseeds in a specified magnetic field strength and frequency. Values of ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatment variables including temperature, location and number of thermoseeds are determined for an irregular tumor geometry with constant thermal properties and tissue perfusion rate. Near-optimal values of these treatment variables are determined with an objective function. The objective function maximizes the fraction of tumor cells killed during a treatment while minimizing normal cell death. The fractions of tumor and normal cells killed during treatment are determined from cell-survival data."

			Abstract="Seventeen 5 to 6-month-old Holstein heifer calves were divided into three groups and fed either a control ration alone or a control ration with sufficient sodium fluoride added to furnish an additional 30 or 50 p.p.m. fluoride based on total dry matter intake. After 6 years of the feedings, mean (SEM) fluoride concentrations in the metacarpals were found to be 594.6 (66.2), 2663.8 (319.2), and 4500.0 (417.8) p.p.m. Bone mineral density and mechanical evaluations were also conducted on the harvested metacarpals after the 6-year period. Using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, mean (SEM) bone mineral densities of 3.030 (0.26), 2.801 (0.34), and 2.456 (0.19) g cm-2 for the control group, the group receiving 30 p.p.m. fluoride, and the group receiving 50 p.p.m. respectively were found. For the mechanical testing, specimens were cut and tested in compression parallel to the long axis of the metacarpals. Mean (SEM) ultimate stress of 204.53 (3.63), 208.83 (5.25), and 205.93 (5.12) MPa and mean (SEM) Young&#x27;s elastic moduli of 20.82 (1.52), 22.68 (2.38), and 21.55 (1.60) GPa for the control, the 30 p.p.m., and the 50 p.p.m. fluoride groups respectively were determined. No significant differences were found between control and treatment groups for either mechanical properties or bone mineral density."

			Abstract="A device has been designed and fabricated to measure the cross-sectional area of soft connective tissues ex vivo. It consists of two displacement transducers: one sensing tissue thickness and the other sensing width. Outputs are recorded (via an analog to digital interface) using a personal computer. Numerical integration of a thickness versus width plot computes cross-sectional area. This plot also provides a quality check of acquired data. The data were successfully used in biomechanical studies of rabbit patellar tendons, rat medial collateral ligaments, and dissected specimens of human fascia."

			Abstract="Intersegmental forces and moments (i.e. resultant free body forces and moments computed at the joint centers) were studied in canine hindlimbs before and after cemented total hip replacement (THR). Five large, adult, mixed-breed dogs were selected. Their gait was recorded (while leash-walked) before surgery using high-speed cinematography and a force plate. Cemented total hip replacement was unilaterally performed on each dog. Gait was again recorded at one and four months after surgery. Segmental properties (mass, center of mass, and mass moment of inertia) of the hindlimbs were experimentally determined, and an inverse dynamics approach was used to compute intersegmental forces and moments in the sagittal plane. Significant reductions in intersegmental joint forces and moments were observed in the operated hindlimb one month after surgery, although kinematic gait parameters were unaltered. Decreases of 77.0% for vertical forces, 61.9% for craniocaudal forces, and 66.2% for extension moments were determined. Four months after surgery, the joint forces and moments had returned to their preoperative values. This experiment demonstrates that the dynamics of normal walking can be restored in a canine model by four months after THR. It also shows that kinetic (rather than kinematic) parameters are more descriptive of antalgic gait in the canine."

			Abstract="Primate patellar tendons were subjected to different regimens of preconditioning, regimens that could be reasonably implemented during surgery, and then held at a fixed deformation to measure viscoelastic behavior. Twenty primate patella-patellar tendon-tibia complexes were divided into four groups. Group one was cyclically preconditioned for 10 minutes, unloaded for 10 minutes, and then tested for stress relaxation. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were held at fixed displacement for 10 minutes and subsequently unloaded for 1, 10, and 30 minutes respectively before undergoing stress relaxation testing. Results showed that the percent drop-off in load was significantly less for preconditioned ligaments than for ligaments that were not conditioned. Further, the percent drop-off increased as the time between preloading and stress relaxation test increased. The fixed deformation preconditioning was found to have significantly less load drop-off than the cyclic preconditioning."

			Abstract="Ground reaction forces were studied in the hindlimbs of ten dogs after cemented and cementless total hip replacement. The femoral components in five dogs were surgically press fitted into the medullary canal for porous ingrowth fixation (cementless) while the remaining five dogs had their femoral component cemented in place. Gait analysis was performed monthly for four postoperative months. Reductions in vertical ground reaction forces were observed in both cemented and cementless implanted hindlimbs one and two months after surgery. By three months postoperative, both groups had effectively returned to their preoperative vertical ground reaction force levels on the implanted hindlimb. At three and four months post implantation, the cemented group demonstrated equal load distribution between the operated and unoperated hindlimbs, whereas the cementless group showed a disparity in load distribution between the operated and unoperated hindlimbs which persisted for the four-month test period. We believe that the paired comparisons between operated and unoperated limbs are more descriptive of antalgic gait than comparisons with preoperative control values."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study was to investigate if experimental strain analysis is predictive of femoral adaptation after total hip replacement (THR). Ten large adult dogs underwent unilateral THR with identical implants. Five implants were press fit for porous ingrowth fixation, and five were cemented. Four months after surgery femora were harvested. Strain gauge rosettes were applied to the femora at eight proximal locations. Femora were compressively loaded on the head of the femur or femoral component. Strain data represented three conditions: preoperative, acutely postoperative, and four-month postoperative. The unoperated femur of each dog was used to simulate preoperative acutely postoperative behavior of the contralateral implanted femur. Strains from each condition were compared. Transverse femoral sections were obtained through the levels of the strain gauges. Fine detailed radiographs were used to quantify morphological changes. Results are discussed."

			Abstract="Anterior cervical discetomy and fusion is an accepted surgical procedure for disc herniation or spondylosis. It is not without complications however, most commonly related to nonunion, particularly in multi-level procedures, and graft donor site morbidity. Discectomy without bone graft and the use of allograft bone have been used to eliminate donor site morbidity. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the effectiveness of three techniques: 1) discectomy without bone graft, 2) with autograft fusion, and 3) with fresh frozen allograft fusion, in an animal model. Biomechanical evaluation of post surgical stability and fusion was compared with the results of histologic and radiographic analyses. Generally autogenous graft material gave the highest fusion rate and the highest stiffness characteristics."

			Abstract="After canine hip replacement, the effects on the material properties of the collared and collarless femoral components surrounding bone were compared. Ultrasound velocities and bone mineral densities were measured and used to calculate the changes in the axial modulus of elasticity of the cortex surrounding the implant. The results showed no difference between the collared and collarless designs for the particular fiber mesh style of implant used. Significant decreases in velocities were noted after four months of implantation for both implant designs at midstam and distal locations. Bone mineral densities (using DEXA) also displayed decreased values after four months of implantation. Elasticity moduli calculated from the ultrasound velocities and DEXA densities were consistently less after four months of implantation when compared to acute implantation."

			Abstract="A two-dimensional, finite-element program has been written and a thermal model of interstitial ferromagnetic implants has been developed for optimal treatment planning of cancerous tumors with ferromagnetic hyperthermia. An iterative technique has been implemented to include the power-temperature relationship of 0.9 mm diameter, nickel-copper thermoseeds in a specified magnetic field strength and frequency. Values of ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatment variables including temperature, location and number of thermoseeds are determined for an irregular tumor geometry with constant thermal properties and tissue perfusion rate. Near-optimal values of these treatment variables are determined with an objective function. The objective function maximizes the fraction of tumor cells killed during a treatment while minimizing normal cell death. The fractions of tumor and normal cells killed during treatment are determined from cell-survival data."

			Abstract="Differential infrared thermography represents the emergence of a new experimental technique for biomechanical application. It provides a means of analysis which is based on an unexploited physical phenomenon, thus offering an entirely new range of research opportunities. This method also provides an effective full-field alternative to current experimental strain analysis techniques. Thermographical analysis showed consistent results for an orthotropic material such as bone. By establishing the feasibility of this particular technique with a controlled test specimen, material parameters can be developed lending to the analysis of a more complex structure such as an entire femur. In conclusion, this study has shown that differential infrared thermography is a useful technique for qualitative and quantitative biomechanical applications."

			Abstract="Bone remodeling has been shown to correlate with alterations in strain patterns under functional loadings. The long-term performance of a joint replacement prosthesis is then dependent upon achieving an appropriate strain distribution to ensure a homeostatic condition in the supporting bone. Previous studies with both cemented and cementless femoral hip components have shown that strain is substantially altered with prosthetic implantation. This study compares femoral strain adaptation 4 months after total hip arthroplasty in dogs receiving either a cemented or a porous ingrowth femoral component."

			Abstract="Intersegmental forces and moments were used to quantify functional changes during gait before and after cemented total hip replacement (THR) in a canine model. This work reports the intersegmental forces and moments for one dog. On the operated hip, intersegmental forces and moments were greatly reduced postoperatively, but they returned very close to normal in magnitude and pattern after 4 months. Compensation was observed postoperatively on the nonoperated hip with elevated intersegmental forces and moments. This kinetic compensation returned very close to normal after 4 months. Functional changes in gait were more apparent in the kinetic parameters than in the kinematic parameters."

			Abstract="Self-regulating ferromagnetic implants (thermoseeds) can be heated with magnetic induction to prodce localized hyperthermia, even in deep tumors. However, the heating patterns produced by this new technique need to be thoroughly studied and optimized before clinical trials can begin. To gain insight into the spatial distributions of temperature during ferromagnetic heating, parametric simulations were performed using the finite element method to solve the modified bioheat transfer equation. Steady-state, two-dimensional temperature distributions were calculated for idealized tumor regions implanted with thermoseeds. The implanted tissue was assumed to have constant thermophysical properties and the thermoseeds were assumed to be heated to their Curie temperatures. This model was validated by comparing computed results with experimental data measured in the model by varying the spacing and Curie points of the thermoseeds in tissues with differing rates of blood perfusion. Results demonstrate the sensitivity of the temperature distributions to these modeling parameters."

			Abstract="A biomechanical analog predicting the relative spinal stability in idiopathic scoliosis has been developed based upon the classical theory of curved beam-columns. The basic postulate is that the elastic load bearing capacity of a given scoliotic curve defines its spinal stability and that this capacity can be given scoliotic curve defines its spinal stability and that this capacity can be quantified in terms of its so-called critical load (Pcr). The critical load is the axial (cranial-caudal) load at which the elastic limit of the scoliotic curve is reached. To exceed this load would (with time) produce non-recoverable deformation and the curve would progress. The computation Pcr is based upon a maximum allowable moment criterion. To demonstrate mathematical interdependencies, a general solution of the governing differential equation is obtained. The solution relates spinal stability to the magnitude of initial curvature and to curve pattern. Finite element solutions are then formulated to facilitate the inclusion of more general structural and material properties, distributed axial loadings, and more general boundary conditions. Parametric finite element analyses include the relative stability of scoliotic spines during periods of clinical observation (small curves), and stability increases for alternative surgical treatment (large curves). Because all results are in consistent qualitative agreement with clinical observations, the proposed analog appears useful to predict the progression potential of (treated and untreated) scoliotic curves."

			Abstract="Four adult mongrel dogs weighing 24-26 kilograms were selected for unilateral total hip arthroplasty. A modification of the Canine II Total Hip (Richards Medical Co. ) was manufactured by Biomet, Inc. and implanted. Stem thickness of the femoral component was reduced and plasma sprayed metal beads were added to the proximal stem. Two implants were manufactured from titanium alloy and two from cobalt-chromium alloy. The animals were full weight-bearing and allowed to exercise freely in individual runs. All were radiographed postoperatively and at one month intervals. At the end of the four month period, the animals were sacrificed and right and left femurs were harvested. Specimens were stored at -80 degree C prior to testing. Calcar strains after prostheses insertion were found to be extremely dependent on collar contact. But regardless of the initial collar contact, strain patterns in all specimens returned very close to normal after 4 months, indicating strain adaptation present in all four femurs. Gross evaluation revealed good fixation of the implant."

			Abstract="A numerical algorithm is used to estimate in-vivo segmental stiffness properties of individual spine segments based upon existing load-displacement data. A static nonlinear finite element model stimulates a pathological spine and corrective instrumentation system. A systematic procedure for establishing the model&#x27;s stiffness parameters is described, in the form of a nonlinear constrained optimal design problem. The numerical method is demonstrated using as an example a case of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis requiring corrective surgery."

			Abstract="Spinal instrumentation and fusion are used to correct and stabilize curves in idiopathic scoliosis which cannot be managed by orthoses. Several factors are considered in deciding the vertebral levels included in the fusion. These factors include: the curve pattern (single, double), degree of lateral curvature (Cobb angle), flexibility of curves (primary, compensatory), and location of apical segments (thoracic, thoracolumbar, lumbar). Clinical studies have attempted to correlate these factors with good long-term results following fusion. However, the selection of fusion levels in double curves remains an area of controversy. The purpose of this study is to suggest a biomechanical rationale for the selection of fusion levels in double curves."

			Abstract="Creep and relaxation are two viscoelastic phenomena that are easily interrelated for a linearly viscoelastic material, but interrelationships are complex for nonlinearly viscoelastic materials. We use a single-integral nonlinear superposition principle to relate creep and relaxation, where the kernel is assumed to be a nonseparable product of strain and time. Herein, we develop time dependence as general power laws with up to four terms for creep compliance and relaxation modulus. Higher-order formulations give better results for ligament in terms of curve fitting and prediction of relaxation from creep. This is illustrated by a comparison between a two- and a three-term formulation on the experimental data of rabbit medial collateral ligaments. Also, an interrelation between several aspects of creep and relaxation is presented for arbitrarily high order, and the nature of high-order interrelation is discussed. The generality of the method makes it suitable to phenomenologically model many complex materials, to predict complex behaviors and to therefore reduce the amount of testing for robust material characterization.

			Abstract="Connective tissue mechanical behavior is primarily determined by the composition and organization of collagen. In ligaments and tendons, type I collagen is the principal structural element of the extracellular matrix, which acts to transmit force between bones or bone and muscle, respectively. Therefore, characterization of collagen fibril morphology and organization in fetal and skeletally mature animals is essential to understanding how tissues develop and obtain their mechanical attributes. In this study, tendons and ligaments from fetal rat, bovine, and feline, and mature rat were examined with scanning electron microscopy. At early fetal developmental stages, collagen fibrils show fibril overlap and interweaving, apparent fibril ends, and numerous bifurcating/fusing fibrils. Late in fetal development, collagen fibril ends are still present and fibril bundles (fibers) are clearly visible. Examination of collagen fibrils from skeletally mature tissues, reveals highly organized regions but still include fibril interweaving, and regions that are more randomly organized. Fibril bifurcations/fusions are still present in mature tissues but are less numerous than in fetal tissue. To address the continuity of fibrils in mature tissues, fibrils were examined in individual micrographs and consecutive overlaid micrographs. Extensive microscopic analysis of mature tendons and ligaments detected no fibril ends. These data strongly suggest that fibrils in mature ligament and tendon are either continuous or functionally continuous. Based upon this information and published data, we conclude that force within these tissues is directly transferred through collagen fibrils and not through an interfibrillar coupling, such as a proteoglycan bridge.

			Abstract="Acoustoelastic analysis has usually, beet? applied to compressible engineering materials. Many materials (e.g., rubber and biologic materials) are &#x22;nearly&#x22; incompressible and often assumed incompressible in their constitutive equations. These material models do not admit dilatational waves for acoustoelastic analysis. Other constitutive models (for these materials) admit compressibility but still do not model dilatational waves with fidelity (shown herein). It? this article a new strain energy,junction is formulated to model dilatational wave propagation in nearly it? compressible, isotropic materials. This strain energy function requires four material constants and is a function of Cauchy-Green deformation tensor invariants. This function and existing (compressible) strain energy functions are compared based upon their ability to predict dilatational wave propagation in uniaxially prestressed rubber Results demonstrate deficiencies in existing functions and the usefulness of our new function for acoustoelastic applications. Our results also indicate that acoustoelastic analysis has great potential for the accurate prediction of active or residual stresses in nearly, incompressible materials."

			Abstract="Die-cast aluminum alloys are heavily used in small engines, where they are subjected to long-term stresses at elevated temperatures. The resulting time-dependent material responses can result in inefficient engine operation and failure. A method to analytically determine the stress relaxation response directly from creep tests and to accurately interpolate between experimental time-history curves would be of great value. Constant strain, stress relaxation tests and constant load, creep tests were conducted on aluminum die-casting alloys: B-390, eutectic Al-Si and a 17% Si-Al alloy. A nonlinear superposition integral was used to (i) interpolate between empirical primary inelastic creep-strain and stress-relaxation time histories and (ii) to determine the stress relaxation response from corresponding creep data. Using isochronal stress-strain curves, prediction of the creep response at an intermediate stress level from empirical creep curves at higher and lower stresses resulted in a correlation (R) of 0.98. Similarly for relaxation, correlations of 0.98 were obtained for the prediction of an intermediate strain level curve from higher and lower empirical relaxation curves. The theoretical prediction of stress relaxation from empirical creep curves fell within 10% of experimental data."

			Abstract="An existing logarithmic time base pulse generator design has been modified to collect data for creep and relaxation tests over at least 14 decades of logarithmic time increments. Creep and relaxation studies of materials, which do not obey time temperature superposition, are done over many factors of ten (decades) of time. To acquire and store data efficiently one employs logarithmic sampling intervals. This device can trigger a data acquisition system to gather the data logarithmically. It generates trigger pulses accurately over 14 decades of time."

			Abstract="Numerous studies have examined wound healing and tissue repair after a complete tissue rupture and reported provisional matrix and scar tissue formation in the injury gap. The initial phases of the repair are largely mediated by the coagulation response and a principally extrinsic inflammatory response followed by type III collagen deposition to form scar tissue that may be later remodeled. In this study, we examine subfaiture (Grade II sprain) damage to collagenous matrices in which no gross tissue gap is present and a localized concentration of provisional matrix or scar tissue does not form. This results in extracellular matrix remodeling that relies heavily upon type I collagen, and associated proteoglycans, and less heavily on type III scar tissue collagen. For instance, following subfailure tissue damage, collagen I and III expression was suppressed after I day, but by day 7 expression of both genes was significantly increased over controls, with collagen I expression significantly larger than type III expression. Concurrent with increased collagen expression were significantly increased expression of the collagen fibrillogenesis supporting proteoglycans fibromodulin, lumican, decorin, the large aggregating proteoglycan versican, and proteases cathepsin K and L. Interestingly, this remodeling process appears intrinsic with little or no inflammation response as damaged tissues show no changes in macrophage or neutrophils levels following injury and expression of the inflammatory markers, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were unchanged. Hence, since inflammation plays a large role in wound heating by inducing cell migration and proliferation, and controlling extracellular matrix scar fort-nation, its absence leaves fibroblasts to principally direct tissue remodeling. Therefore, following a Grade II subfailure injury to the collagen matrix, we conclude that tissue remodeling is fibroblast-mediated and occurs without scar tissue formation, but instead with type I collagen fibrillogenesis to repair the tissue. As such, this system provides unique insight into acute tissue damage and offers a potentially powerful model to examine fibroblast behavior.

			Abstract="Cyclic loading induces fatigue in bone and initiates a complex, functionally adaptive response. We investigated the effect of a single period of fatigue on the histologic structure and biomechanical properties of bone. The ulnae of 40 rats were subjected to cyclic fatigue (-6000 muepsilon) unilaterally until 40% loss of stiffness developed, followed by 14 days of adaptation. The contralateral ulna served as a treatment control (n = 20 rats), and a baseline loaded/non-loaded group (n = 20 rats/group) was included. Bones from 10 rats/group were examined histologically and the remaining bones (10 rats/group) were tested mechanically. The following measurements were collected: volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD); ultimate force (F-u); stiffness (S); energy-to-failure (0; cortical area (Ct.Ar); microcrack density (Cr.Dn); microcrack mean length (Cr.Le); microcrack surface density (Cr.S.Dn); osteocyte density (Ot.N/T.Ar and Ot.N/TV); bone volume fraction (B.Ar/T.Ar); resorption space density (Rs.N/Ct.Ar); and maximum and minimum area moments of inertia (I-MAX and I-MIN), Using confocal microscopy, the bones were examined for diffuse matrix injury, canalicular disruption, and osteocyte disruption. The adapted bones had increased B.Ar, I-MAX,I- and I-MIN in the mid-diaphysis. Fatigue loading decreased structural properties and induced linear microcracking. At 14 days, adaptation restored structural properties and microcracking was partially repaired. There was a significant nonlinear relationship between OLN/T.Ar and B.Ar/T.Ar during adaptation. Disruption of osteocytes was observed adjacent to microcracks immediately after fatigue loading, and this did not change after the period of adaptation. In fatigue-loaded bone distant from microcracks, diffuse matrix injury and canalicular disruption were often co-localized and were increased in the lateral (tension) cortex. These changes were partially reversed after adaptation. Loss of canalicular staining and the presence of blind-ends in regions with matrix injury were suggestive of rupture of dendritic cell processes. Taken together, these data support the general hypothesis that the osteocyte syncytium can respond to cyclic loading and influence targeted remodeling during functional adaptation. Changes in the appearance of the osteocyte syncytium were found in fatigue-loaded bone with and without linear microcracks. We hypothesize that the number of dendritic cell processes that experience load-related disruption may determine osteocyte metabolic responses to loading and influence targeted remodeling.

			Abstract="The goal of this study was to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of the rabbit medial collateral ligament (MCL) at multiple levels of strain (between 0% and similar to5%) and their corresponding stresses (between 0 and similar to55 MPa) for stress relaxation and creep, respectively. We hypothesized that in the rabbit MCL the rate of stress relaxation would be strain dependent and the rate of creep would be stress dependent. Thirty MCLs from 15 rabbits were tested ex vivo for this study. Results show that within the physiologically relevant region of ligament behavior, the rate of stress relaxation is strain dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of relaxation decreasing with increasing tissue strain. The rate of creep is stress dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of creep decreasing with increasing stress. These results support our hypothesis, with the greatest nonlinearities in a physiologically relevant region of loading. As such, these nonlinearities should be considered when quantifying ligament viscoelastic behavior with a rabbit model."

			Abstract="Creep and stress relaxation are known to be interrelated in linearly viscoelastic materials by an exact analytical expression. In this article, analytical interrelations are derived for nonlinearly viscoelastic materials which obey a single integral nonlinear superposition constitutive equation. The kernel is not assumed to be separable as a product of strain and time dependent parts. Superposition is fully taken into account within the single integral formulation used. Specific formulations based on power law time dependence and truncated expansions are developed. These are appropriate for weak stress and strain dependence. The interrelated constitutive formulation is applied to ligaments, in which stiffness increases with strain, stress relaxation proceeds faster than creep, and rate of creep is a function of stress and rate of relaxation is a function of strain. An interrelation was also constructed for a commercial die-cast aluminum alloy currently used in small engine applications."

			Abstract="Failure of bone adaptation to protect the skeleton from fatigue fracture is common, and site-specific accumulation and coalescence of microcracking in regions of high strain during cyclic loading is considered a key factor that decreases the resistance of whole bones to fracture. We investigated the effect of cyclic fatigue loading on the monotonic structural properties of the rat ulna during accumulation and coalescence of microcracks. Cyclic end-loading of the ulna was performed at 4 Hz ex vivo at an initial peak strain of -6000 muepsilon to 20% loss of stiffness (n = 7) or 40% loss of stiffness (n = 7) bilaterally. A 0% loss of stiffness monotonically loaded control group (n = 7) was also included. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), ultimate strength (F-u), stiffness (S), and energy-to-failure (U) were determined in one ulna and in the contralateral ulna vBMD, cortical bone area (B.Ar), maximum and minimum second moments of inertia (I-MAX and microcrack density (Cr.Dn), microcrack mean length (Cr.Le), and microcrack surface density (Cr.S.Dn) were determined. In two additional groups of rats, cyclic end-loading of the ulna was also performed ex vivo unilaterally to 20% loss of stiffness (n = 10) and 40% loss of stiffness (n = 10) and then vBMD, F-u, S, U, B.Ar, I-MAX, and I-MIN, were determined bilaterally. Fatigue loading had incremental degradative effects on ulna structural properties. This decreased resistance to fracture was associated with accumulation and coalescence of branching arrays of microcracks within the cortex of the ulna. Microcracking was most prominent in the middiaphysis and corresponded to the region of the bone that fractured during monotonic structural testing. Fatigue loading influenced the relationship between bone cross-sectional geometry and vBMD and ulna structural properties. At 40% loss of stiffness, Fu, S, and U were all significantly correlated with cross-sectional bone geometry and vBMD, whereas this was not the case at 20% loss of stiffness and with the 0% loss of stiffness monotonic control ulnae. We also found a biologically significant individual animal effect. Larger ulnae required a higher number of load cycles for fatigue to develop, retained higher strength, and accumulated a greater amount of microcracking at the end of the cyclic fatigue testing.

			Abstract="CORR, D. T., G. E. LEVERSON, R. VANDERBY JR., and T. M. BEST. A Nonlinear Rheological Assessment of Muscle Recovery from Eccentric Stretch Injury. Med. Sci. Sports Exere., Vol. 35, No. 9, pp. 1581-1588, 2003. Purpose: To better understand the mechanical behavior of healing skeletal muscle; specifically the tissue&#x27;s response after acute eccentric stretch injury. Methods: Rabbit tibialis anterior (TA) muscle tendon units were subjected to an in vivo single stretch (eccentric) injury and mechanically evaluated (constant rate elongation to failure) at 1, 3, and 7 d postinjury. In addition to a traditional linear analysis (finear stiffness and failure load), an existing nonlinear rheological model was modified to interpret the experimental load-to-failure data. The models&#x27; performance were evaluated and discussed. Results: No significant injury effect was observed, either within or between groups. across the 7-d healing interval, using the linear analysis. However, interpretation of the data using Our nonlinear phenomenological model identified significant changes in mechanical behavior that went undetected by linear analyses. Percent differences, between injured and contralateral control limbs. of model parameter estimates were analyzed. Nonpararnetric statistical analysis illustrated significant changes in the first-order stiffness (k(1)) throughout the 7-d healing interval. Model simulations using mean values of each parameter revealed increased low-load tissue compliance after injury, with a decrease in finear slope that recovered steadily toward control values by day 7. At 7 d postinjury, virtually no differences were observed between injured and sham control tissues. Conclusions: Our finding&#x27;s suggest that acute eccentric injury increases the muscle&#x27;s compliance 24 h after injury, with a steady recovery to uninjured values by the 7th day, yet these changes went undetected by linear analysis. Therefore, nonlinear analysis is necessary to recognize valuable information contained in the low-load region and to quantify important biomechanical phenomena of stretch-injured healing skeletal muscle."

			Abstract="An existing rheological model of skeletal muscle (Forcinito et al., 1998) was modified with a nonlinear Maxwell fluid element to provide a phenomenological model capable of analyzing the strain-stiffening behavior typically found in passive, and occasionally observed in active, skeletal muscle. This new model describes both active and passive muscular behavior as a combination of the behavior of each model component, without requiring prior knowledge of the force-length or force-velocity characteristics of the muscle."

			Abstract="Objective-To determine the optimal fixation technique for equine interdental space fractures by evaluating the biomechanical characteristics of 4 fixation techniques. Study Design-In vitro randomized block design. Sample Population-Twenty-seven adult equine mandibles. Methods-Mandibles with interdental osteotomies were randomly divided into 4 fixation groups (n = 6/group). Fixation techniques were the following: (1) dynamic compression plates (DCP), (2) external fixator (EF), (3) external fixator with interdental wires (EFW), and (4) intraoral splint with interdental wires (ISW). Three intact (nonosteotomized) mandibles were tested as controls. Mandibles were subjected to monotonic cantilever bending until failure. Angular displacement data (radians) were derived from continuously recorded gap width measurements provided by extensometers placed across the osteotomy site. Osteotomy gap width data (mm) at 50 and 100 Nut were selected for standardized comparison of gap width before the yield point and failure point, respectively of all constructs tested. Stiffness (Nm/radian), yield strength (Nm), and failure strength (Nm) were determined from bending moment-angular displacement curves and were compared using ANOVA with appropriate post hoc testing when indicated. Radiographs were obtained prefixation, postfixation, and posttesting. Results-Bending stiffness, yield, and ultimate failure loads were greatest for intact mandibles. Among osteotomized mandibles, stiffness was greatest for DCP constructs (P &#x3c; .05) and was not significantly different among EF, EFW, and ISW constructs. Yield load was greatest for ISW constructs (P &#x3c; .05) and was not significantly different among DCP and EFW constructs. Yield and ultimate failure loads were lowest (P &#x3c; .05) and osteotomy gap width at 50 and 100 Nm were greatest for EF constructs (P = .09 and P &#x3c; .05, respectively). There was no significant difference in failure loads and osteotomy gap widths among DCP, EFW, and ISW constructs (P &#x3c; .05). Failure occurred through the screw-bone interface (DCP), acrylic splint (ISW), acrylic connecting bar and/or pin-bone interface (EF, EFW), and wire loosening (EFW). All 3 intact mandibles fractured through the vertical ramus at its attachment to the testing apparatus. Conclusions-Among osteotomized mandibles, DCP fixation had the greatest stiffness under monotonic bending to failure; however, the relatively low yield value may predispose it to earlier failure in fatigue testing without supplemental fixation. Techniques using tension-band wiring (EFW and ISW) were similar to DCP constructs in yield, failure, and osteotomy displacement, whereas EF constructs were biomechanically inferior to all other constructs. Clinical Relevance-DCP fixation is most likely the most stable form of fixation for comminuted interdental space fractures. However, for simple interdental space fractures, ISW fixation may provide adequate stability with minimal invasiveness and decreased expense. Tension-band wiring significantly enhances the strength of type II external skeletal fixators and should be used to augment mandibular fracture repairs.

			Abstract="This study shows how a probabilistic microstructural model for fibrous connective tissue behavior can be used to objectively describe soft tissue low-load behavior More specifically, methods to determine tissue reference length and the transition from the strain-stiffening &#x22;toe-region&#x22; to the more linear region of the stress-strain curve of fibrous connective tissues are presented. According to a microstructural model for uniaxially loaded collagenous tissues, increasingly more fibers are recruited and bear load with increased tissue elongation. Fiber recruitment is represented statistically according to a Weibull probability density function (PDF). The Weibull PDF location parameter in this formulation corresponds to the stretch at which the first fibers begin to bear load and provides a convenient method of determining reference length. The toe-to-linear region transition is defined by utilizing the Weibull cumulative distribution function (CDF) which relates the fraction of loaded fibers to the tissue elongation. These techniques are illustrated using representative tendon and ligament data from the literature, and are shown to be applicable retrospectively to data from specimens that are not heavily preloaded. The reference length resulting from this technique provides an objective datum from which to calculate stretch, strain, and tangent modulus, while the Weibull CDF provides an objective parameter with which to characterize the limits of low-load behavior."

			Abstract="This study determined microdamage associated with external fixation pin insertion and short-term cyclical loading, using an ex vivo ovine tibial model. Orthofix tapered blunt-tipped 3.5/4.5 mm fixation pins and Apex(R) self-drilling self-tapping fixation pins, 4 mm in diameter, were used. After insertion, the constructs were either loaded in cantilever bending or not loaded. Constructs were then bulk-stained in basic fuchsin, and calcified sections were made. The sections were reviewed qualitatively and the microcrack surface density (Cr.S.Dn, mum/mm(2)) was quantified at the pin-bone interface. The pattern and quantity of microdamage induced was significantly influenced by fixation pin design and cortical region within the cis- or trans- cortex, but not short-term cyclical loading. Overall, Cr.S.Dn was significantly increased with use of the Orthofix fixation pin (P &#x3c; 0.01). Cr.S.Dn was also increased in the medial cis-cortex, compared with the lateral trans- cortex (P &#x3c; 0.05). Diffuse damage within the medial (is-cortex was higher with the Orthofix pin. In contrast, the Howmedica Apex(R) fixation pin caused fracture of the periosteal region of the lateral trans- cortex, but relatively little microdamage within the medial cis-cortex. In this model as a consequence of pin insertion, fixation pin design had significant specific damage effects on both the medial cis-cortex and the lateral trans-cortex."

			Abstract="The goal of this study was to determine the duration of time that ligaments from a study group need to be loaded in order to adequately determine their collective viscoelastic behavior. Rat ligaments were subjected either to creep or stress relaxation for 1,000 s or stress relaxation for 10,000 s to compare estimates of viscoelastic behavior for different test durations. Stresses versus time (relaxation) or strains versus time (creep) were fit with power law models (t(beta) where beta is the rate of creep or relaxation on a log-log scale). Time intervals were separated by logarithmic decade and analyzed using a Random Coefficients approach to compute residual specimen error as a function of the number of decades of data analyzed. Standard Regression was also used for comparison. Results show that by testing for less than or equal to100 s (i.e. two logarithmic decades of time) offers 1% less accuracy than testing for 1,000 seconds (i.e. three decades) when estimating the viscoelastic behavior of a specimen. These 100 s power law estimates are far more accurate than the between specimen dispersion of viscoelastic properties. Hence, a better way to compare viscoelastic behavior between study groups is to test more specimens for shorter durations. This reduces experimental time per sample and therefore increases efficiency."

			Abstract="The objective of this study was to observe and compare behavior of the collagen fiber microstructure in normal and healing ligaments, both in situ and ex vivo, in order to add insight into the structure-function relationship in normal and healing ligaments. Fifty-two ligaments from 26 male rats were investigated. Eleven animals underwent surgical transection of both medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) (22 ligaments), which were allowed to heal for a period of 2 weeks. An additional 15 animals (30 ligaments) were used as normals. Ligaments were placed into six groups: Slack ( n = 6 control, n = 6 healing), Reference ( n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), Loaded ( n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 15degrees Flexion ( n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 120degrees Flexion ( n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), and Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle ( n = 8 normals). All ligaments, except those in the Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle group, were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Tissues were harvested, mounted in a load frame, and chemically fixed in one of five states: (1) slack, (2) reference (onset of loading), (3) loaded, (4) 15degrees knee flexion, or (5) 120degrees knee flexion. After fixation the tissues were prepared for electron microscopy (SEM). The micrographs from the slack, reference, and loaded groups show fiber straightening with loading in normal ligaments as well as in both scar and &#x22;retracted&#x22; regions of healing ligaments. Collagen fibers&#x27; diameter and crimp patterns were dramatically changed in the scar region of healing ligaments: Width decreased from 19.4 +/- 1.7 mum to 6.5 +/- 2.1 mum ( p &#x3c; .000001), period from 51.4 +/- 15.1 mum to 11.0 +/- 2.4 mum ( p &#x3c; .000001), and amplitude from 9.8 +/- 0.8 mum to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mum ( p &#x3c; .000001). Normal ligaments fixed in situ show wavy regions at 120degrees but less so at 15degrees flexion. Healing ligaments fixed in situ show regions of fiber waviness in the scar region at 120degrees and also at 15degrees flexion, indicating ligament laxity persists toward both extremes of the range of motion. The data suggest that straightening of crimped fibers is a functionally relevant phenomenon, not only in normal but also in healing ligaments."

			Abstract="Transection of the canine anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a well-established osteoarthritis (OA) model. This study evaluated a new method of canine ACL disruption as well as canine knee joint laxity and joint capsule (JC) contribution to joint stability at two time points (16 and 26 weeks) after ACL disruption (n = 5/time interval). Ten crossbreed hounds were evaluated with force plate gait analysis and radiographs at intervals up to 34 weeks after monopolar radiofrequency energy (MRFE) treatment of one randomly selected ACL. Each contralateral ACL was sham treated. The MRFE treated ACLs ruptured approximately eight weeks (mean 52.5 days, SEM +/- 1.0, range 48-56 days) after treatment. Gait analysis and radiographic changes were consistent with established canine ACL transection models of OA. Anterior-posterior (AP) translation and medial-lateral (ML) rotation were measured in each knee at 30degrees, 60degrees, and 90degrees of flexion with and then without JC with loads of 40 N in AP translation and 4 Nm in NIL rotation. A statistically significant interaction in AP translation included JC by cruciate (P = 0.02), and there was a trend for a cruciate by time (P = 0.07) interaction. Significant interactions in NIL rotational testing included the presence of joint capsule (P = 0.0001) and angle by cruciate (P = 0.0012). This study describes a model in which canine ACLs predictably rupture approximately eight weeks after arthroscopic surgery and details the contribution of JC to canine knee stability in both ACL intact and deficient knees. The model presented here avoids the introduction of potential surgical variables at the time of ACL rupture and may contribute to studies of OA pathogenesis and inhibition. This model may also be useful for insight into the pathologic changes that occur in the knee as the ACL undergoes degeneration prior to rupture. (C) 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

			Abstract="Medicinal leeches are used to treat venous congestion, a complication of reconstructive surgery. Despite substantial drawbacks of leeching, little progress has been made to develop a device that would replace the leech for this purpose. The goal of this study was to develop and test mechanical prototypes for the treatment of venous congestion. We tested four prototypes (1, 2, 3a, and 3b) using congested fasciocutaneous flaps in swine. Blood removed by each prototype was measured for up to 4 hours. On average, the four prototypes removed 609%, 644%, 853%, and 811% more blood, respectively, from congested flaps versus a leech. Prototypes 3a and 3b, which allowed for innovative subcutaneous chemical (3a and 3b) and mechanical (3b) anticoagulation at the bleeding wound, sustained high levels of blood removal for up to 4 hours. Thus, a mechanical device can potentially replace the use of leeches for treating venous congestion."

			Abstract="Reconstructive microsurgery is performed to reattach, transfer, or transplant body tissues. Venous congestion is a complication that threatens the viability of the affected tissue and is often treated with medicinal leeches. Leech therapy has two phases: active bloodletting and passive bleeding from the leech wound after detachment, which can last for several hours. Unfortunately, the small blood volumes removed by medicinal leeches are generally ineffective in decongesting tissue. Our goal was to develop a device to augment blood removal during the passive-bleeding phase of leech therapy with the use of a porcine model of venous congestion. Results indicated that the use of the device resulted in significant increases in blood retrieval relative to reports of passive bleeding alone (141%, 156%, and 155% in 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively). These results are an encouraging first step toward development of a mechanical device that completely replaces the use of medicinal leeches in modem medicine."

			Abstract="This study evaluated biomechanical properties of healing ligament following subfailure (grade 11) injury by comparing Young and mature animals in a rat lateral collateral ligament (LCL) model. One randomly selected LCL was stretched in situ using a custom designed device in eighteen young (21 days) and eighteen skeletally mature (8 months) male rats. Animals were euthanized at 0, 7, and 14 days post-surgery, and ligament ultimate stress, strain at failure and laxity were determined (n = 6 pairs per group). At time 0 after introduction of stretch injury, ligament laxity was present in both groups. The mature rats had 54 +/- 9% strength of the control while the immature rats had 58 +/- 11%) of the strength of the control, representing a consistent and significant injury. The immature and mature ligaments showed similar patterns of cellular damage post-injury and had similar modes of mechanical failure. Ligament laxity decreased in each group as healing time increased, however ligament laxity did not completely recover in either group after 2 weeks of healing. After 7 and 14 days of healing, the mature rats, respectively, had only 63 +/- 14% and 80 +/- 8% strengths of the controls while the immature rats had 94 +/- 6% and 94 +/- 10%. Hence, mechanical data showed that immature animals recovered their strength after a grade 11 sprain at a faster rate than mature animals. However, ligament laxity was still present in both groups two weeks after the injury and was not completely removed by growth in the immature group. These findings are clinically relevant since joint laxity after injury is common, and these results may explain the presence of continued instability in a joint injured at a young age. Hence, this study, with a new injury model, showed differences in ligament healing associated with maturity and quantified the clinically observed persistance of ligament laxity.

			Abstract="Ligaments display time-dependent behavior; characteristic of a viscoelastic solid, and are nonlinear in their stress-strain response. Recent experiments(25) reveal that stress relaxation proceeds. more rapidly than creep in medial collateral ligaments, a fact not explained by linear viscoelastic theory but shown by Lakes and Vanderby(17) to be consistent with nonlinear theory. This study tests the following hypothesis: nonlinear viscoelasticity of ligament requires a description more general than the separable quasilinear viscoelasticity (QLV) formulation commonly used. The experimental test for this. hypothesis involves performing both creep and relaxation studies at various loads and deformations below the damage threshold. Freshly harvested, rat medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) were used as a model. Results consistently show a nonlinear behavior in which the rate of creep is dependent upon stress level and the rate of relaxation is dependent upon strain level. Furthermore, relaxation proceeds faster than creep; consistent with the experimental observations of Thornton et al.(25) The above results from rat MCLs are not consistent with a separable QLV theory. Inclusion of these nonlinearities would require a more general formulation. (C) 2001 Biomedical Engineering Society."

			Abstract="This study used a rat model to investigate the microstructural organization of collagen through the transition from sear to intact residual segments of a healing medial collateral ligament (MCL). Twenty-two mate retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly separated into two groups. Eleven underwent surgical transections of both MCLs and were allowed unrestricted cage activity until euthanized two weeks post surgery. The remaining eleven rats were used as normal controls. All 44 MCLs were harvested including intact femoral and tibial insertions and prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. At harvest the scar region in the healing ligaments was more translucent than the normal tissue. Ligaments were viewed from femoral to tibial insertions at magnifications of 100X through 20,000X. Tissue away from the scar region in the transected MCLs was indistinguishable from normal tissue in uninjured ligaments. Collagen fibers and fibrils in these tissues were more aligned along the longitudinal axis of the ligament than in the scar tissue. Continuity of collagen fibers and fibrils were consistently observed from the residual portions of the transected ligament through the scar region. Bifurcations/fusions, but no anastomoses, in fibers and fibrils were observed in both normal and scar tissues of ligaments. Qualitatively, bifurcations were encountered more frequently in scar tissue. In the transition region, larger diameter fibers from the residual tissue bifurcated into smaller diameter fibrils in the scar. This connection between larger diameter and smaller diameter fibers and fibrils indicates that bifurcations/fusions are likely to be the dominant way in which force is transmitted from a region with larger fibrils (residual ligament) into and through a region with smaller fibrils (sear)."

			Abstract="A nonlinear Maxwell fluid model consisting of a linear dashpot in series with a parallel arrangement of a linear spring and a second-order nonlinear spring, was developed. This configuration provides the flexibility necessary to describe both the stiffening and the softening responses of some viscoelastic materials. A noteworthy feature of the model is that under constant rate displacement, the force equation can be solved in closed form, thereby providing a continuous, exact general solution."

			Abstract="This study compared the effect of augumentation of allograft-host bone junctions with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS), autogenous cancellous bone graft (CBG), and a collagen sponge alone in a canine intercalary femoral defect model repaired with a frozen allograft. Outcome assessment included serial radiographs, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, and gait analyses, and mechanical testing and histology of post-mortem specimens. The distal junction healed more quickly and completely with rhBMP-2 than ACS alone based on qualitative radiography and histologic evaluations. The primary tissue in the unhealed gaps in the ACS group was fibrous connective tissue. The proximal allograft-host bone junction had complete bone union in the three treatment groups. There was significantly greater neu bone callus formation at both junctions with rhBMP-2 than with CBG or ACS alone that resulted in increased bone density around the allograft-host bone junctions. All dogs shifted their weight from the treated leg to the contralateral pelvic limb immediately after surgery. Weight bearing forces were redistributed equally between the pelvic limbs at 12 weeks after surgery with rhBMP-2, at 16 weeks after surgery with CBG, and at 24 weeks after surgery with ACS alone. Bending and compressive stiffnesses of the whole treated femora were equal to the contralateral control femora in all treatment groups, whereas torsional rigidities of the whole treated femora for the CBG and ACS groups were significantly less than the control. Both the proximal and distal junctions the treated with rhBMP-2 had torsional stiffnesses and strengths equal to intact control bones, Ultimate failure torques of the proximal junctions of the CBG group and of both junctions of the ACS group were significantly less than the BMP-treated bones. Augmentation of the allograft-host bone junctions with rhBMP-2 on an ACS gave results for all parameters measured that equaled or exceeded autogenous graft in this canine intercalary femoral defect model.

			Abstract="The goal of this study was to expand understanding of strain-generated potential (SGP) in ligamentous or tendinous tissues. Most SGP studies in the past have focused on cartilage or bone. Herein, rabbit patellar tendon (PT) was used as a model. Each patellar tendon had two Ag/AgCl electrodes inserted at axial positions of 1/4 and 1/2 from patellar to tibial insertions. Each specimen was electrically isolated, gripped iii a servohydraulic test system, and then subjected to a short session of uniaxial haversine tension (2.5 percent maximum strain) at a frequency of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 5.0 Hz. A cyclic (sinusoidal) electrical potential superimposed upon a larger transient (exponentially asymptotic) potential was consistently observed Upon termination of loading, the cyclic SGP ended, and the shifted baseline of the SGP exponentially decayed and asymptotically returned to a residual potential which over all specimens was not different than the original potential. The transient and cyclic SGPs were frequency dependent (P&#x3c;0.001, P=0.06, respectively). To our knowledge, this transient portion of the SGF, although theoretically predicted by Suh (1996, Biorheology, 33, pp. 289-304) and Chen (1996, Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison) has not been observed in other experiments using different protocols. Additional PTs were dehydrated and the rehydrated in solution at different pH levels. The magnitude of SGPs increased in basic solution (pH 9.5) but diminished in pH 4.7 buffer. This pH dependency suggests that electrokinetics is the dominant mechanism for the transient and cyclic responses of the SGPs, although this study does not provide direct evidence.

			Abstract="Radiofrequency energy may provide a relatively noninvasive method to stabilize joints with excessive laxity by thermally shrinking redundant joint capsular tissue. The authors determined the percentage of shrinkage associated with five radiofrequency treatment temperatures and evaluated the effect of this energy on the structural properties of joint capsular tissue in vitro. First, 36 adult sheep femoropatellar joint capsular specimens were treated with one of five treatment temperatures (n = 6 per group) or served as a control to determine tissue shrinkage. An additional 24 specimens were treated with three temperatures that resulted in different shrinkage: 45 degrees C, 65 degrees C, and 85 degrees C, Tissue stiffness, relaxation, and failure strength were determined for each specimen (n = 6 per group). Tissue shrinkage was correlated significantly with treatment temperature. There was a significant decrease in tensile stiffness in the 65 degrees C and 85 degrees C treatment groups. There were no significant differences between stress relaxation before treatment and after treatment. Relaxation properties after treatment were not different from each other or from control values either normalized to pretreatment values or expressed as raw data. Failure strength was not affected significantly at any temperature."

			Abstract="Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine neck muscle forces and spinal loads that result from isometric muscle contractions. Methods: Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the neck musculature and a three-dimensional biomechanical model of the neck were used. The model was EMG-based and estimated muscle forces and spinal loads at the C4/5 level. EMG signals were collected from eight sites at the C4/5 level of the neck using Ag-AgCl surface. electrodes from 10 adult male subjects. The subjects performed isometric contractions gradually developing to maximum efforts in flexion, extension, left lateral bending, and right lateral bending. Results: During maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) trials most muscles generated high levels of EMG signal during cervical rotation. The posterior surface of the neck (trapezius) was the only electrode site at which maximum activity EMG consistently occurred by the same method (rotation) in all subjects. Variations in the EMG patterns were observed in different experiments that produced overall neck moments of equal magnitudes. With these data Che model computed variations in load distribution among the agonist muscles. Consistent also with EMG distributions, the model also computed co-contractions of antagonist muscles. The average (+/- SD) magnitudes of peak moments were 28.3 (+/- 3.3) Nm in. extension, 17.7 (tt: 3.1) Nm in flexion, 16.9 (+/- 2.8) Nm in left lateral bending, and 17.0 (+/- 2.9) Nm in right lateral bending. The model predicted C4/5 joint compressive forces during peak moments were 1372 (+/- 140) N in extension, 1654 (+/- 308) N in flexion, 956 (+/- 169) N in left lateral bending, and 1065 (+/- 207) N in right lateral bending. Conclusions: Results suggest that higher C4/5 joint loads than previously reported are possible during maximum isometric muscle contractions."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nonablative laser energy on mechanical, histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical properties of joint capsular tissue in an in vivo sheep model. Femoropatellar joint capsule was treated with the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser via an arthroscope, and tissues were harvested immediately after surgery, or at 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after surgery (n = 8/group). Laser treatment caused significant decreases in tissue stiffness from 0 to 7 days after surgery, then stiffness gradually increased after 14 days. Tissue strength was lowest 3 days after laser treatment. Histologic examination revealed immediate collagen hyalinization and cell necrosis, followed by active cellular response characterized by extensive fibroblast migration and capillary sprouting. Tissue appeared to be normal histologically 60 days after surgery; however, collagen fibrils remained uniformly small. This study showed an active tissue response secondary to thermal modification with concomitant recovery of mechanical properties by 30 days after surgery. Whether the shrinkage or joint stability was maintained with time remains to be evaluated. To clarify the advantages and disadvantages of this technique, a carefully controlled clinical trial with long term followup should be performed."

			Abstract="This study used radiography, gait analysis, gluteal muscle mass, mechanical testing, and qualitative histology to compare three methods of gluteal muscle attachment to an allograft/endoprosthetic composite of the proximal 25% of the femur in an in vivo canine model. The three methods of gluteal muscle attachment were identical to those used clinically in human patients for hip revision and proximal femoral limb salvage: the host gluteal tendon sutured to the allograft tendon (tendon group), the host greater trochanter with intact gluteal tendons secured to the allograft with a cable-grip system (grip group), and periosteally vascularized proximal femoral bone onlay with intact tendons wrapped around the allograft (wrap group). On the basis of radiographs taken every 2 months, the tendon group had more graft fractures than did the grip or wrap group. Radiographic union of the graft-host bone junction occurred more rapidly and there was less graft resorption in the wrap group than in the other two groups. In all dogs, peak vertical ground-reaction forces in the treated limb decreased immediately after surgery and then slowly increased over the length of the study. The dogs in the wrap group regained normal weight-bearing on the treated limb more quickly than did those in the other groups. The constructs in the tendon group were weaker and less stiff immediately after surgery than were those in the other groups or in intact controls. Histologic analysis confirmed that the wrap technique resulted in complete union of the host bone-allograft junction more often than did the: other techniques. The wrap method had the best functional outcome after 9 months when an allograft/endoprosthetic composite was used during total hip arthroplasty in this canine model."

			Abstract="An impulse-momentum exercise system was instrumented for collection of kinematic and kinetic data during shoulder exercise. The objective of this study was to quantify the dynamics of an exercise system that utilizes a weighted shuttle (22.2 N) traveling on a rail system and evaluate its efficacy as an exercise and rehabilitative tool. Two healthy adults (mean age, 30.0 years) were tested utilizing 2 protocols. The first protocol required the subject to maintain tension in the system while externally rotating the upper arm from neutral to 90 degrees relative to the shoulder and then internally rotating back to the initial position. Tn the second protocol, the range of motion was similar, but each subject was instructed to carry out the exercise as rapidly as possible without regard to the tension in the rope, thus creating an impulsive load. Average peak loads up to 87.9 and 137.0 N were recorded using the first and second protocols, respectively. Average maximum loads using the second protocol were approximately 50 N greater than those using the first protocol (p &#x3c;.05). Representative calculations demonstrated that less mechanical work was performed during the first protocol (-3.8 to -45.9%). Qualitatively the shuttle acceleration curves appear dramatically different, although similar average peak accelerations are achieved during use (4.12 vs. 3.47 m/s(2), protocol I vs. protocol 2, respectively)."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study was to understand the mechanism responsible for joint capsule shrinkage after nonablative laser application in an in vitro sheep model. Femoropatellar joint capsular tissue specimens harvested from 20 adult sheep were treated with one of three power settings of a holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser or served as a control. Laser treatment significantly shortened the tissue and decreased tissue stiffness in all three laser groups, whereas Failure strength was not altered significantly by laser treatment. Transmission electron microscopic examination showed swollen collagen fibrils and loss of membrane integrity of fibroblasts, A thermometric study revealed nonablative laser energy caused tissue temperature to rise in the range of 64 degrees C to 100 degrees C, Electrophoresis after trypsin digestion of the tissue revealed significant loss of distinct alpha bands of Type I collagen in laser treated samples, whereas alpha bands were present in laser treated tissue without trypsin digestion, The results of this study support the concept that the primary mechanism responsible for the effect of nonablative laser energy is thermal denaturation of collagen in joint capsular tissue associated with unwinding of the triple helical structure of the collagen molecule."

			Abstract="Experimental data (Thornton et al., 1997) show that relaxation proceeds more rapidly (a greater slope on a log-log scale) than creep in ligament, a fact not explained by linear viscoelasticity. Ait interrelation between creep and relaxation is therefore developed for ligaments based on a single-integral nonlinear superposition model. This interrelation differs from the convolution I-elation obtained by Laplace transforms for linear materials. We demonstrate via continuum concepts of nonlinear viscoelasticity that such a difference in rate between creep and relaxation phenomenologically occurs when the nonlinearity is of a strain-stiffening type, i.e., the stress-strain curve is concave Icp as observed in ligament. We also show that it is inconsistent to assume a Fung-type constitutive law (Fung, 1972) for both creep and relaxation. Using the published data of Thornton et al. (1997), the nonlinear interrelation developed herein predicts creep behavior from relaxation data well (R greater than or equal to 0.998). Although data are limited and the causal mechanisms associated with viscoelastic tissue behavior are complex, continuum concepts demonstrated here appear capable of interrelating creep and relaxation with fidelity."

			Abstract="Objective-To compare the mechanical properties of two stabilization methods for ostectomized equine third metacarpi (MC3): (1) an interlocking nail system and (2) mio dynamic compression plates. Animal or Sample Population-Ten pairs of adult equine forelimbs intact from the midradius distally. Methods-Ten pairs of equine MC3 were divided into two test groups (five pairs each): caudocranial four-point bending and torsion. Interlocking nails (6 hole, 13-mm diameter, 230-mm length) were placed in one randomly selected bone from each pair. Two dynamic compression plates one dorsally (12 hole, 4.5-mm broad) and one laterally (10 hole, 4.5-mm broad) were attached to the contralateral bone from each pair. All bones had 1 cm mid-diaphyseal ostectomies. Five construct pairs were tested in caudocranial four-point bending to determine stiffness and failure properties. The remaining five construct pairs were tested in torsion to determine torsional stiffness and yield load. Mean values for each fixation method were compared using a paired t-test within each group. Significance was set at P &#x3c; .05. Results-Mean (+/-SEM) values for the MC3-interlocking nail composite and the MC3-double plate composite, respectively, in four-point bending were: composite rigidity, 3,454 +/- 407.6 Nm/rad and 3,831 +/- 436.5 Nm/rad; yield bending moment, 276.4 +/- 40.17 Nm and 433.75 +/- 83.99 Nm. failure bending moment, 526.3 +/- 105.9 Nm and 636.2 +/- 27.77 Nm. There was no significant difference in the biomechanical values for bending between the two fixation methods. in torsion, mean (+/-SEM) values for the MC3-interlocking nail composite and the MC3-double plate composite were: composite rigidity, 124.1 +/- 16.61 Nm/rad and 262.4 +/- 30.51 Nm/rad; gap stiffness, 222.3 +/- 47.32 Nm/rad and 1,557 +/- 320.9 Nm/rad; yield load, 94.77 +/- 7.822 Nm and 130.66 +/- 20.27 Nm, respectively. Composite rigidity, Sap stiffness, and yield load for double plate fixation were significantly higher compared with interlocking nail fixation in torsion. Conclusions-No significant differences in biomechanical properties were identified between an interlocking nail and double plating techniques for stablilization of ostectomized equine MC3 in caudocranial four-point bending. Double plating fixation was superior to interlocking nail fixation in torsion. Clinical Relevance-Double plate fixation is biomechanically superior to interlocking nail fixation in vitro in ostectomized equine MC3 bones.

			Abstract="This study developed a three-dimensional biomechanical model to investigate the internal loads on the human neck that result from isometrically generated loads resisted by a force on the head. The first goal was to apply the double-optimization (DOPT) method, the EMG-based method, and the EMG assisted optimization (EMGAO) method to the neck model, calculating muscle forces and C4/5 cervical joint loads for each method. The second goal was to compare the results of the different methods, and the third was to determine maximum exertion forces in the cervical spine for isometric contractions. To formulate the EMG-based model, electromyographic signals were collected from 10 male subjects. EMG signals were obtained from 8 sites around the C4/5 level of the neck by surface electrodes, while the subject performed near maximum, isometric exertions. The mean maximum values (+/-SD) calculated for C4/5 joint compressive forces during peak exertions were 1654 (+/-308) N in flexion by the EMG method, 1674 (+/-319) N in flexion by the EMGAO method, and 1208 (+/-123) N in extension by the DOPT method. In contrast to the DOPT method, the EMG and EMGAO methods showed activation of all the muscles, including the antagonists, and accommodated various load distribution patterns among the agonist muscles during generation of the same magnitude of moments, especially in lateral bending. The EMG and EMGAO methods predicted higher cervical spinal loads than previously published results by the DOPT method. These results may be helpful to engineers and surgeons who are designing and using cervical spine implants and instrumentation."

			Abstract="A novel approach is developed for mathematically modeling the variability observed in experimentally determined elastic moduli of longitudinally oriented fibrous tissues such as ligaments and tendons. The elastic modulus of these tissues is modeled with a rule of mixtures (ROM) where each parameter (fibril and matrix moduli and fibril volume fraction) is assumed to be an independent random variable. A joint density Function formed from the independent densities results in a probabilistic ROM (pROM). This pROM is used to generate a distribution of moduli which agrees well with moduli determined from tests of rabbit medial collateral ligaments (Woo and Ohland, 1994, Unpublished experimental data as gift). Minimizing the error between the pROM and experimental distributions resulted in an integrated error of 9% for a constrained set of independent distribution parameters derived from the literature. This pROM thus incorporates microstructural observations (fibril and matrix moduli and fibril volume fraction) to partially explain the experimentally observed variability in a macroscopic property (tissue modulus).

			Abstract="This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the Holmium:YAG laser for performing lateral release and medial joint capsular tightening intracapsularly and to compare the efficacy of the laser versus a scalpel blade for performing a lateral release by performing arthroscopic surgery on 29 caprine patellofemoral joints. Specimens were divided into six treatment groups and treatments consisted of lateral release alone, medial capsular tightening alone, or both treatments, and the effect of each treatment on patellar tracking was evaluated using video analysis of optical markers, Each treatment caused significantly different magnitudes of medial patellar displacement throughout a 75 degrees range of motion: medial tightening followed by lateral release (1.5 +/- 0.10 mm, mean +/- standard error of the mean); lateral release followed by medial tightening (1.1 +/- 0.11 mm); medial tightening alone (0.73 +/- 0.10 mm); lateral release alone (0.36 +/- 0.09 mm); and sham (-0.15 +/- 0.05 mm), There were no significant differences between performing the lateral release using the laser (1.5 +/- 0.10 mm) versus a scalpel (1.4 +/- 0.11 mm), This study shows that lateral release can be performed as effectively with the laser as with a scalpel and that the laser is an effective tool for performing lateral release and medial joint capsular tightening procedures intracapsularly in this caprine model."

			Abstract="Collagen fibrils in ligaments and tendons are highly organized into parallel arrays which influence interstitial fluid transport. Finite element (FE) models were developed analogous to the fibrillar arrays in ligaments and tendons to investigate interstitial fluid flow and tissue permeability as a function of interfibrillar spacing and fluid properties. Collagen fibrils were assumed to be a periodic square array of impermeable cylinders. A two-dimensional FE model was used to study transverse fluid flow and a three-dimensional model was used to study flow parallel to the collagen fibrils. Parametric FE analysis provided data to formulate empirical expressions for permeability (kappa) as a function of porosity (phi). Results show that longitudinal permeability (kappa = 1.1.10(-15)phi(2.5)[1 - phi](-0.333)) can be up to 50 times higher than transverse permeability (kappa = 1.2.10(-15)phi(0.5)[phi - phi(min)](2.5)) in a compact array. Maximum fluid shear stresses occur at the narrowest zones of adjacent fibrils (1.21 Pa or 12.1 dyn/cm(2) at 10 mu m/s of average transverse influx). If interstitial fluid is highly non-Newtonian, the permeability should be considered as flow (shear)-dependent, The computational results suggest that tissue permeability in ligaments and tendons is highly anisotropic, porosity-dependent, and can be estimated by analytic expressions."

Subsequently, an in vivo study was performed to compare the effects of augmenting the interlocking nail with five combinations of intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate and autogenous cancellous bone applied to the periosteal surface or within the medullary canal. Dogs were killed 6 months after the procedure for biomechanical evaluation of the femora in axial compression, mediolateral and craniocaudal bending, and torsion. Results from the in vitro study at the proximal osteotomy indicated the 6-mm interlocking nail with intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate had greater stiffness than the 5-mm interlocking nail without it (p &#x3c; 0.05). At the distal osteotomy, regardless of the diameter of the interlocking nail, the addition of intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate increased stiffness (p &#x3c; 0.05). Results from the in vivo study indicated greater global construct stiffness with an interlocking nail alone, an interlocking nail augmented with intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate and cancellous bone at the periosteal surface, and an interlocking nail augmented with cancellous bone within the medullary canal and at the periosteal surface (p &#x3c; 0.05). At the osteotomy level, the interlocking nail augmented with intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate and cancellous bone at the periosteal surface had greater stiffness than did an interlocking nail alone or an interlocking nail augmented with either intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate, cancellous bone within the medullary canal, or cancellous bone at the periosteal surface (p &#x3c; 0.05) but produced the same results as an interlocking nail augmented with cancellous bone within the medullary canal and at the periosteal surface. The results suggest that augmenting interlocking nail fixation with intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate by itself offers no advantage but that a combination of intramedullary polymethylmethacrylate and cancellous bone at the periosteal surface improves structural properties at 6 months."

			Abstract="Background: Rat cortical bone adaptation to chronic hypergravity (2G) was studied using young growing male Wistar rats (60 d). Methods: Animals (10 rats) were subjected to chronic hypergravity (14 d) in order to understand the plastic nature of bone under a constant hypergravity stress using a special rodent habitat that was attached to a 12-ft. radius centrifuge. Also, an equal number of stationary controls were housed in a rodent vivarium containing identical cages that were used for centrif ugation. After 14 d of centrifugation, femur bones were excised and prepared for morphological and biochemical measurements. Results: Results showed that 2G had significantly shortened the femurs (3%) and reduced the cortical bone area (13%). In particular, hypergravity induced significant reductions in the thicknesses of cortical bone at the anterior (13%) and medial regions (15%) of the middiaphysis. However, femoral bone density, collagen and calcium concentrations were unaltered. The content of mature, stable bone collagen cross-links hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP), lysylpyridinoline (LP), were significantly greater in bones from centrifuged animals. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that short term exposure to 2G does not enhance bone formation or induce changes in cortical bone composition, or alter specific gravity. These data also suggest that bone maturation as reflected by collagen crosslinking is upregulated. However, it is undetermined at this time whether the enhanced content of mature bone collagen in the centrifuged rats is a result of either an increased rate of cross-linking or reduction in the degradation of &#x22;older collagen.&#x22;"

			Abstract="The variety of techniques used to measure the cross-sectional area of soft connective tissues during mechanical testing lead to inconsistencies in elastic descriptions. This study compares the numerical differences between finite elasticity (Eularian and Lagrangian formulations) and infinitesimal elasticity when considering stress, strain and elastic modulus of ligamentous tissue. Our results found stress differences (Cauchy versus Kirchhoff) of 22.4%, strain differences (engineering versus Green versus Almansi) as large as 14% and elastic modulus differences (Eularian versus Lagrangian) of 44% from ligament tissue sampled from rats. It is therefore critical to maintain consistent (energy conjugate) elastic formulations for reporting mechanical evaluation of soft hydrated tissue."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study is to describe interstitial fluid flow in axisymmetric soft connective tissue (ligaments or tendons) when they are loaded in tension. Soft hydrated tissue was modelled as a porous medium (using Darcy&#x27;s Law), and the finite element method was used to solve the resulting equations governing fluid flow. A commercially available computer program (FiDAP) was used to create an axisymmetric model of a biomechanically tested rat ligament. The unknown variables at element nodes were pressure and velocity of the interstitial fluid (Newtonian and incompressible). The effect of variations in fluid viscosity and permeability of the solid matrix was parametrically explored. A transient loading state mimicking a rat ligament mechanical experiment was used in all simulations. The magnitude and distribution of pressure, stream lines, shear (stress) rate, vorticity and velocity showed regular patterns consistent with extension flow. Parametric changes of permeability and viscosity strongly affected fluid flow behaviour. When the radial permeability was 1000 times less than the axial permeability, shear rate and vorticity increased (approximately 5-fold). These effects (especially shear stress and pressure) suggested a strong interaction with the solid matrix. Computed levels of fluid flow suggested a possible load transduction mechanism for cells in the tissue."

			Abstract="Herein we describe a new test system to produce a standardized partial muscle-tendon junction (MTJ) stretch injury. In anaesthetized rabbits the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle-tendon unit is unilaterally shortened using a custom designed clamp roller system. An angular displacement (average velocity of 450 degrees.s(-1)) is applied about the foot to plantarflex the ankle 90 degrees while the lower extremity is fixed. during ankle rotation the TA muscle is tetanically stimulated to generate an eccentric stretch injury at the MTJ. Forty-eight hours after injury, isometric torque deficit (injured/sham) was measured. Two groups of animals (N = 6 in each group) were tested with the only difference between the two groups being the initial tendon shortening. In Group 1 (tendon shortening = 1.2 cm, N = 6) the torque deficit was 36.7 +/- 5.9% (mean +/- SD). In Group 2 (tendon shortening = 1.5 cm, N = 6) the torque deficit was 58.7 +/- 7.4% (mean +/- SD). No order effect was suggested by the data (P = 0.6062), but the difference in torque deficit between the two groups was highly significant (P = 0.0001). For all tests in which the tendon was temporarily shortened before muscle stimulation and stretch (N = 12) there was a visible hematoma at the MTJ similar to the injury that is common in athletic injuries. Histological evaluation 48 h after injury revealed both fiber tearing and inflammation at the MTJ. In addition, there was focal fiber damage in the muscle belly for both groups. The damage and inflammatory process, however, were more severe in the group with greater initial tendon shortening."

			Abstract="Clinical fatigue failure of 6 mm diameter interlocked nails (ILN) with holes accommodating 3.5 mm screws has been reported. This problem was investigated by testing eight different designs of 6 mm and 8 mm diameter ILN with a 2 plus 2 screw hole pattern and a multiple holed pattern. Interlocking nails with holes to accommodate 3.5 and 4.5 mm screws in 8 mm ILN and 2.7 and 3.5 mm screws in 6 mm diameter ILN were used. A rotating beam testing device produced uniform bending moments across a test region of the ILN containing at least two holes. These moments fully reversed with each cycle. Fatigue failure occurred through screw holes. Using statistical modeling, reduction of the 6 mm ILN hole size from accommodating 3.5 screws to 2.7 mm screws increased the estimated fatigue life (EFL) of the latter by 52 times, comparable to the EFL of the 8 mm ILN with 4.5 screw holes. Reducing the 8 mm ILN screw hole size from accommodating 4.5 screws to 3.5 mm screws increased the comparative EFL by eight times. Fatigue testing is a good method to compare fatigue behavior of various implant designs. This gives a surgeon more information when selecting an ILN for fracture fixation."

			Abstract="We propose a mechanical model for tendon or ligament stress-stretch behavior that includes both microstructural and tissue level aspects of the structural hierarchy in its formulation. Al the microstructural scale, a constitutive law for collagen fibers is derived based on a strain-energy formulation. The three-dimensional orientation and deformation of the collagen fibrils that aggregate to from fibers are taken into consideration. Fibril orientation is represented by a probability distribution function that is axisymmetric with respect to the fiber. Fiber deformation is assumed to be incompressible and axisymmetric. The matrix is assumed to contribute to stress only through a constant hydrostatic pressure term. At the tissue level, an average stress versus stretch relation is completed by assuming a statistical distribution for fiber straightening during tissue loading. Fiber straightening stretch is assumed to be distributed according to a Weibull probability distribution function. The resulting comprehensive stress-stretch law includes seven parameters, which represent structural and microstructural organization, fibril elasticity, as well as a failure criterion. The failure criterion is stretch based. It is applied at the fibril level for disorganized tissues bur can be applied more simply at a fiber level for well-organized tissues with effectively parallel fibrils. The influence of these seven parameters on tissue stress-stretch response is discussed and a simplified form of the model is shown to characterize the nonlinear experimentally determined response of healing medial collateral ligaments. In addition microstructural fibril organizational data (Frank et al., 1991, 1992) are used to demonstrate holy fibril organization affects material stiffness according to the formulation. A simplified form, assuming a linearly elastic fiber stress versus stretch relationship, is shown to be useful for quantifying experimentally determined nonlinear toe-in and failure behavior of tendons and ligaments. We believe this ligament and tendon stress-stretch law can be useful in the elucidation of the complex relationships between collagen structure, fibril elasticity, and mechanical response."

			Abstract="A system was refined for the determination of the bulk ultrasonic wave propagation velocity in small cortical bone specimens. Longitudinal and shear wave propagations were measured using ceramic, piezoelectric 20 and 5 MHz transducers, respectively. Results of the pulse transmission technique were refined via the measurement of the system delay time. The precision and accuracy of the system were quantified using small specimens of polyoxymethylene, polystyrene-butadiene, and high-density polyethylene. These polymeric materials had known acoustic properties, similarity of propagation velocities to cortical bone, and minimal sample inhomogeneity. Dependence of longitudinal and transverse specimen dimensions upon propagation times was quantified. To confirm the consistency of longitudinal wave propagation in small cortical bone specimens ( 0.997) were maintained between propagation time and distance throughout the size ranges down to less than 0.4 mm. Results for polyoxymethylene, polystyrene-butadiene, and high-density polyethylene were accurate to within 5 percent of reported literature values. Measurement repeatability (precision) improved with an increase in the wave transmission distance (propagating dimension). No statistically significant effect due to the transverse dimension was detected."

			Abstract="In a canine model, the fixation stability of a prosthesis and proximal bone graft composite were measured relative to the distal femur. One group had the prosthesis graft composite cemented into the distal femur. The second group had the prosthesis graft composite press fit into the distal femur for biologic ingrowth. Displacements of the proximal femoral grafts relative to the host hone in each group were measured after ex vivo (acute with graft) implantation and 4 months after implantation. A third group with no osteotomy (acute intact) simulated perfect graft to host bone union. Relative displacements representing 6 degrees freedom (translation and rotation) were calculated from the displacement values measured by 9 eddy current transducers. Measurements of displacement were used to test the hypothesis that distal press fit fixation equals distal cement fixation at 4 months after implantation. In all cases the measured translations and rotations of the graft to implant construct were small and of a magnitude that should encourage bone ingrowth (&#x3c;0.05 mm and &#x3c;0.1 degrees, respectively). The stability of the press fit group at 4 months was not significantly different from the cemented group in axial and transverse displacement during axial and transverse loading, respectively. There was no difference in stabilities at 4 months between distal press fit and cemented fixation in hip replacements requiring a proximal femoral graft."

			Abstract="Thermographic strain analysis (TSA) was used to measure the surface strain distribution of cyclically loaded canine femora. Eleven canine femora were cyclically loaded ar 20 Hz in compression at 600 N (+/-200 N). After calibration with measured local strain data, it was Possible to quantify the full field patterns measured from the proximal, anterior and medial cortex. The average of each TSA signal normalized by the coincident strain data (0.996) was very near to 1.0 (p=0.999). The thermographical scans iterate the maximum compressive strains carried by the femur within the region just distal to the femoral neck. Further understanding of the strain distribution in this region is critical in the design of components that attempt to mimic anatomical load transfer after total hii, arthroplasty. TSA appears to offer a promising technology as a full field experimental strain analysis method for use with biomechanical Issues. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd."

			Abstract="A refinement of the current ultrasonic elasticity technique was used to measure the orthotropic elastic properties of rat cortical bone as well as to quantify changes in elastic properties, density, and porosity of the dwarf rat cortex after a treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). The ultrasonic elasticity technique was refined via optimized signal management of high-frequency wave propagation through cubic cortical specimens. Twenty dwarf rats (37 days old) were randomly assigned to two groups (10 rats each). The dwarf rat model (5-10% of normal GH) was given subcutaneous injections of either rhGH or saline over a 14-day treatment period. Density was measured using Archimedes&#x27; technique. Porosity and other microstructural characteristics were also explored via scanning electron microscopy and image analysis. Statistical tests verified significant decreases in cortical orthotropic Young&#x27;s (-26.7%) and shear (-16.7%) moduli and density (-2.42%) concomitant with an increase in porosity (+125%) after rhGH treatments to the dwarf model (p &#x3c; 0.05). A change in material symmetry from orthotropy toward planar isotropy within the radial-circumferential plane after GH treatments was also noted. These results demonstrate some alteration in bone properties at this time interval. Structural implications of these changes throughout physiological loading regimens should be explored."

			Abstract="This study quantified the orthotropic elastic changes in cortical bone due to aging as well as determined any elastic changes after acute treatments of growth hormone (GH). Three groups of twenty rats represented three age groups of young adult (9 months), middle age (20 months), and old (31 months) rats. During a ten day period, half of the rats in each age group were given twice-daily doses of recombinant human GH while the remaining half were injected with a vehicle control (saline). The effects of aging and GH on the elastic characteristics of cortical bone were quantified via ultrasonic wave propagation. Propagation velocities of longitudinal and shear waves were measured through cubic cortical specimens from the posterior femoral diaphysis. Density was measured by Archimedes&#x27; technique. The normalized, orthotropic elastic properties of Young&#x27;s moduli (E(ii)), shear moduli (G(ij)) and Poisson&#x27;s ratios (v(ij)) were calculated and used to compare the groups (where i and j = 1, 2, or 3 reference the radial, circumferential, and longitudinal axes, respectively). Cortical elastic moduli consistently increased with age with the strongest effects demonstrated in radial dependent properties such as E(11) (+25.3% from 9 to 31 months, p = 0.0004) and G(12) (+12.6% from 20 to 31 months, p = 0.0419). The ratio of transverse to axial displacement (Poisson&#x27;s ratio) typically decreased with age (9 to 31 months) as seen in nu(31) (-24.95%, p = 0.0134) and nu(32) (-20.7%, p = 0.0015). Overall, a ten day treatment with GH produced no global statistical change in elastic properties (p &#x3e; 0.05). However, GH did minimize the age related differences that were measured for E(22), E(33), and nu(32) between the 9 and 31 month old groups essentially returning old bone to its youthful elastic state. These finding add orthotropic detail to the current understanding of changing cortical elastic properties during aging as well as providing a reference for further studies of GH."

			Abstract="Using standard material testing techniques (bending stiffness, torsional stiffness, and maximum torque to failure or yield torque), the structural properties of interlocking nails (IN), canine femora, and IN/femur constructs were determined. Specimens that were tested included: 6 and 8 mm diameter IN with 5 to 10 screw holes (n = 18), and intact canine femora (n = 10), which also, with an IN inserted, formed the intact construct (IC) group,(n = 10). Specimens in the IC group were first tested with an 8 mm diameter IN with zero screws, followed by one and two screws (4.5 mm diameter) in the proximal and distal femur. A fracture model construct (FMC), (n = 14), consisting of a transverse femoral osteotomy with a 3 mm gap, was used with either 6 mm or 8 mm IN. In the 6 mm FMC, one and two 3.5 mm screws were used sequentially in the proximal and distal femoral segment. In the 8 mm FMC, one and two 3.5 mm screws and one and two 4.5 diameter screws were used similarly. When bending forces were applied parallel to IN screw holes, mean IN stiffness was 20% less than with forces perpendicular to the holes (n = 18), (P .05). The mean values of 6 mm FMC with four screws (3.5 mm) were 21% and 33% in torsional stiffness and bending stiffness, respectively, of intact femora values. When tested in torsion, 8 mm FMC failed by bone fracture; 6 mm FMC, in contrast, underwent plastic deformation. In comparing FMC stabilized with an 8 mm IN with two screws (4.5 mm diameter) in each bone segment, to intact femurs, the maximum torque was similar, FMC torsional stiffness was 40% (P &#x3c;.05), and FMC banding stiffness was 65% (P &#x3c;.05).

			Abstract="There is considerable interest in determining whether hypergravity can be used as a countermeasure for microgravity-induced bone loss. This study was conducted on 20 immature male rats in order to investigate possible elastic adaptations of cortical bone in rapidly growing rats exposed to chronic hypergravity. Ten rats were continuously centrifuged for 14 days at twice gravitational acceleration (2G) on a 12.75 foot radius centrifuge and 10 rats concurrently acted as stationary controls. The effect of hypergravity on the elastic characteristics of cortical bone was quantified via ultrasonic wave propagation. Propagation velocities of longitudinal and shear waves were measured through cubic cortical specimens from the posterior femoral diaphyses. Density was measured with an Archimedes&#x27; technique. The orthotropic elastic properties were calculated and used to compare the difference between groups. Results showed an average increase in both the Young&#x27;s moduli (E(ii), + 2.2%) and shear moduli (G(ij,) + 4.3%) with a statistically significant increase only in G(12) (+ 15.7%, P = 0.046). The ratio of transverse to axial strain (Poisson&#x27;s ratio, v(ij)) demonstrated statistically significant changes in v(12,) v(21,) v(13,) and v(31,) (P &#x3c; 0.05). These findings suggest that although slight elastic changes were incurred via a hypergravity environment, the treatment level or duration in this study do not dramatically perturb the normal elastic behavior of cortical bone and that dramatic biomechanical differences noted in previous studies were due more to structural changes than material elasticity changes. Hypergravity applied post facto to a microgravity environment would offer further illucidation of this method as treatment for a degenerative spaceflight experience."

			Abstract="The relative linear and angular displacements of proximal femoral reconstructions were compared within six different replacement techniques during ex vivo axial compression, mediolateral bending, and axial torsion in dogs. Each femur was osteotomized at 25 %, 50 %, or 75 % of its length and the proximal portion subsequently replaced using one of six techniques. The reconstruction techniques included various combinations of proximal and distal fixation methods (graft fixation/distal fixation): (1) an allograft/prosthesis composite (APC) press-fit proximally and cemented distally (press-fit/cement); (2) APC cemented proximally and distally (cement/cement); (3) APC cemented proximally and the host bone/graft interface double plated (cement/plates); (4) APC cemented proximally and secured distally with bicortical screws (cement/screws); (5) APC secured proximally and distally with bicortical screws (screws/screws); (6) Segmental proximal femoral replacement cemented into the distal femur without an allograft (no graft/cement). For axial compression and mediolateral bending, the combined resection lengths revealed no differences in linear and angular displacements, respectively,, between reconstruction methods. During axial torsion, the cement/cement technique allowed larger angular displacements than all but the press-fit/cement technique which had larger displacements than the cement/screws, screws/screws, and no graft/cement groups (P &#x3c; 0.0001). Overall, the measured implant stability was solid and consistent as evidenced by small amounts of relative displacement and small error values."

			Abstract="This study was designed to compare the biomechanical and functional characteristics of allograft/endoprosthetic composites of the proximal 25% of the femur repaired with either a transverse or a step-cut osteotomy, using a canine model (10 dogs, five with each type of osteotomy). Serial radiography and weight-bearing studies were performed monthly, and mechanical testing was done 6 months after surgery. The femora were tested in torsion and compared with the contralateral control (insertion of a femoral component but no osteotomy). At 6 months, the composites with a step-cut osteotomy had 36% greater structural stiffness than the composites with a transverse osteotomy (p &#x3c; 0.005) and 121% greater maximum torque at failure than the controls (p &#x3c; 0.005), without greater structural stiffness. Evaluation of peak vertical ground reaction forces revealed significantly greater weight-bearing on the experimental limb in dogs with a transverse osteotomy. The results of this relatively short-term study were mixed. Despite the increased structural stiffness of the allograft/endoprosthetic composite with a step-cut osteotomy, the dogs with this type of reconstruction had decreased weight-bearing throughout the course of the study The step-cut osteotomy may augment the stability of the allograft/endoprosthetic composite, allowing faster healing (as demonstrated by the results of mechanical testing), but in some way, not understood, may cause pain in the reconstructed limb. Longer term studies are needed to answer these questions and to determine whether alteration of the traditional transverse osteotomy has any advantage."

			Abstract="Cylindrical casts constructed from 2, 3, 4, and 5 inch widths of fiberglass casting material were evaluated for strength in bending using an unstable fracture model. Five-inch casting material produced the strongest casts. The effect of longitudinal splinting with 2-inch fiberglass tape was evaluated in cylindrical casts constructed from 4-inch tape.

			Abstract="This study compared three methods of gluteus medius tendon attachment to an allograft/endoprosthetic composite of the proximal 25% of the femur in a canine model. The three methods were bone to bone, tendon to bone, and tendon to tendon attachment. In an in vivo study, 24 dogs were assigned to three groups of eight dogs each, and serial radiography and weight-bearing analyses were performed throughout the study. The dogs were killed at 6 months, and the specimens were tested in tension to failure and were analyzed histologically. In an in vitro study, each repair was done on six limbs, with a contralateral limb serving as a control for each. In these specimens, the bone to bone attachments were significantly stronger (99.1% of the controls) than the tendon to bone attachments (71.8% of the controls) and the tendon to tendon attachments (40.0% of the controls); there were no differences in tensile stiffness among the three types of attachment. By 6 months, the tensile strength of the tendon to tendon attachments increased significantly and that of the tendon to bone attachments decreased significantly. There were no significant differences in tensile strength among the three types of attachment. The tensile stiffness of the bone to bone attachments (91.0% of the controls) was significantly greater than that of the tendon to bone attachments (40.8% of the controls) but not significantly different from that of the tendon to tendon attachments (63.2% of the controls). The bone to bone attachment was associated with increased bone resorption, bone remodeling, and bone porosity, accompanied by thinner allograft cortices, when compared with the other types of attachment. In dogs with a bone to bone attachment, weight-bearing increased more slowly than in dogs with either of the other two attachments. These changes associated with the bone to bone attachment may merely be secondary to healing of the bone to bone attachment to the greater trochanter; therefore, they may only be temporary phenomena or they may be the portents for long-term complications. Longer term studies of at least 1-2 years must be performed before these questions can be answered."

			Abstract="The structural stiffness and the stiffness of the osteotomy site after six types of reconstruction of the proximal femur were compared by testing in axial compression, mediolateral bending, and axial torsion in a canine model. An osteotomy was carried out for 25, 50, or 75% of the length of each femur, and the proximal portion was replaced by one of five allograft/endoprosthetic composites or a segmental replacement. The reconstructions included (a) a composite press-fit proximally and cemented distally, (b) a composite cemented proximally and distally, (c) a composite cemented proximally and fixed with two plates at the allograft-host bone interface, (d) a composite cemented proximally and secured distally with bicortical screws, (e) a composite secured proximally and distally with bicortical screws, and (f) a segmental prosthesis cemented into the distal femur. The results showed that the segmental reconstruction and the reconstruction with double-plate fixation and a cemented endoprosthesis were structurally stiffer and had greater stiffness of the osteotomy site than the other reconstructions. In comparison, reconstructions that involved cement alone or cement and press-fit techniques generally were more compliant than the others, both structurally and at the osteotomy site."

			Abstract="Purpose: A physiologically based objective function for identifying a combination of ferromagnetic seed temperatures and locations that maximizes the fraction of tumor cells killed in pretreatment planning of local hyperthermia. Methods and Materials: An objective-function is developed and coupled to finite element software that solves the bioheat transfer equation. The sensitivity of the objective function is studied in the optimization of a ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatment. The objective function has several salient features including (a) a physiological basis that considers increasing the fraction of cells killed with increasing temperatures above a minimum therapeutic temperature (T-min,T-thera), (b) a term to penalize for heating of normal tissues above T-min,T-thera, and (c) a scalar weighting factor (gamma) that has treatment implications. Reasonable estimates for gamma are provided and their influence on the objective function is demonstrated. The cell-kill algorithm formulated in the objective function is based empirically upon the behavior of published hyperthermic cell-survival data. The objective function is shown to be independent of normal tissue size and shape when subjected to a known outer-surface, thermal boundary condition. Therefore, fractions of cells killed in tumors of different shapes and sizes tan be compared to determine the relative performance of thermoseed arrays to heat different tumors. Results: In simulations with an idealized tissue model perfused by blood at various rates, maxima of the objective function are unique and identify seed spacings and Curie-point temperatures that maximize the fraction of tumor cells killed. In ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatment planning, seed spacing can be based on maximizing the minimum tumor temperature and minimizing the maximum normal tissue temperature. It is shown that this treatment plan is less effective than a plan based on seed spacings that maximize the objective function. Conclusions: It is shown that under the assumptions of the model and based on a desired therapeutic goal, the objective function identifies a combination of thermoseed temperatures and locations that maximizes the fraction of tumor cells killed."

			Abstract="We examined bone-to-implant relative displacements of acetabular prostheses acutely and after ingrowth in a canine model. Uncemented hemispherical acetabular cups with titanium mesh pads comprising approximately 26% of the surface of the cup were inserted in eight adult canine hemipelves ex vivo. The acetabular prostheses were fixed with 13 mm titanium screws. Zero, one, and two-screw configurations were tested, with the order of testing randomly assigned. A load simulating 1,000 cycles of canine gait was applied to the acetabular component, and relative displacements were measured at three locations between implant and bone to determine acute fixation. A repeated measures analysis of variance showed that two screws produced only 42% of the average relative displacement of one screw and 14% that of zero screws. Eight adult mixed-breed dogs then underwent unilateral total hip arthroplasty. All acetabula were biologically fixed with two cancellous screws. The results at 4 months showed significantly less relative displacement between the implant and bone than was measured in ex vivo implantations (p = 0.014). Bone ingrowth filled 20 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD) of the available space. The relative displacements of these implants were small in all cases (12 +/- 13 mu m) and did not correlate with the amount of bone ingrowth. These data suggest that acetabular fixation with two screws can lead to bone ingrowth and seduced relative motion of the prosthesis under functional loading."

			Abstract="Finite element heat-transfer models of ferromagnetic thermoseeds and catheters are developed for simulating ferromagnetic hyperthermia. These models are implemented into a general purpose, finite element computer program to solve the bioheat transfer equation. The seed and catheter models are unique in that they have fewer modeling constraints than other previously developed thermal models. Simulations are conducted with a 4 x 4 array of seeds in a multicompartment tissue model. The heat transfer model predicts that fractions of tumor greater than 43 degrees C are between 8 and 40% Lower when seed temperatures depend on power versus models which assume a constant seed temperature. Fractions of tumor greater than 42 degrees C, in simulations using seed and catheter models, are between 3.3 and 25% lower than in simulations with bare seeds. It is demonstrated that an array of seeds with Curie points of 62.6 degrees C heats the tumor very well over nearly all blood perfusion cases studied. In summary, results herein suggest that thermal models simulating ferromagnetic hyperthermia should consider the power-temperature dependence of seeds and include explicit models of catheters."

			Abstract="A system is described that allows axial, torsional, and bending testing of biomechanical specimens. The system uses electric motors under closed loop control in its grips allowing application of pure bending moments. These grips attach to an axial/torsional testing system. Thus, it provides simultaneous closed loop control of all three degrees of freedom (D.O.F), so that under any given test condition either the loads or the displacements for each D.O.F. can be maintained at Zero, selected constant values, or simultaneously controlled. This enables the expedient evaluation of the mechanical behavior of biological structures under complex loadings or simple loadings (one D.O.F.) with no artificially induced constraints in the other two D.O.F.&#x27;s due to specimen mounting."

			Abstract="Increases in compartment pressure associated with chronic compartment syndrome (CCS) may be due to changes in the mechanical properties and/or thickness of fascia (4,22). To explore this possibility, we compared the mechanical and biochemical characteristics (stiffness, thickness, time-dependent response, collagen content, and collagen crosslinking) of fascia from patients with symptomatic anterior compartment syndrome to fascia from adjacent collateral compartments. We tested 43 specimens harvested from 20 individuals during surgical fasciectomy. Properties of normal (lateral)-compartment (NC) and pathological (anterior)-compartment (PC) fascia were mechanically tested in the axial and transverse directions forming four groups. An external control group (EX) of six specimens of anterior and lateral-compartment fascia harvested from amputated legs was also included in the study. PC fascia was found to be thicker and structurally stiffer (elastic modulus times thickness) in the axial direction than was NC fascia (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05). No significant differences were found between NC and PC time-dependent response, although significant differences between percent relaxation in the pooled axial and transverse direction specimens were observed. No differences were found in the collagen content, as measured by hydroxyproline (Hyp) concentration, between NC and PC fascia. PC fascia was found to have less collagen crosslinking by hydroxylyslpyridinoline (HP) concentration. In conclusion, although this study does not elucidate etiological factors in CCS, the changes found in PC fascia suggest that fascial mechanical properties contribute to the pathology."

			Abstract="Finite-element solutions to the Pennes bioheat equation are obtained with a model of a tumour-containing, human prostate and surrounding normal tissues. Simulations of ferromagnetic hyperthermia treatments are conducted on the tissue model in which the prostate is implanted with an irregularly spaced array of thermoseeds. Several combinations of thermoseed temperatures with different Curie points are investigated. Non-uniform, constant-rate blood perfusion models are studied and compared with temperature-dependent descriptions of blood perfusion. Blood perfusions in the temperature-dependent models initially increase with tissue temperature and then decrease at higher temperatures. Simulations with temperature-dependent versus constant-rate blood perfusion models reveal significant differences in temperature distributions in and surrounding the tumour-containing prostate. Results from the simulations include differences (between temperature-dependent and constant-rate models) in (1) the percentage of normal tissue volume and tumour volume at temperatures &#x3e; 42-degrees-C, and (2) temperature descriptors in the tumour (subscript t) and normal (subscript n) tissues including T(max,t), T(min,t) and T(max,n). Isotherms and grey-scale contours in the tumour and surrounding normal tissues are presented for four simulations that model a combination of high-temperature thermoseeds. Several simulations show that T(min,t) is between 1.7 and 2.6-degrees-C higher and T(max,n) is between 2.1 and 3.3-degrees-C higher with a temperature-dependent versus a comparable constant-rate blood perfusion model. The same simulations reveal that the percentages of tumour volume at temperatures &#x3e; 42-degrees-C are between 0 and 68% higher with the temperature-dependent versus the constant-rate perfusion model over all seed combinations studied. In summary, a numerical method is presented which makes it possible to investigate temperature-dependent, continuous functions of blood perfusion in simulations of hyperthermia treatments. Simulations with this numerical method reveal that the use of constant-rate instead of temperature-dependent blood perfusion models can be a conservative approach in treatment planning of ferromagnetic hyperthermia."

			Abstract="Effects of canine hip replacement (with a porous-coated femoral component) on the material properties of surrounding cortical bone were evaluated. The hypotheses were: (1) after four months of implantation, mechanical properties of the cortex would change, and (2) a collared implant would be associated with smaller changes than a collarless design. Unilateral total hip arthroplasty was performed in 15 mixed-breed dogs. Nine received a collared and six received a collarless femoral component. Four months after implantation, longitudinal ultrasonic wave propagation velocities and bone mineral densities (from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured in harvested femora and used to calculate the axial elastic constitutive coefficients for the cortex surrounding the implants. Results showed no difference in bone elasticity or bone density between collared and collarless designs. Significant velocity decreases from control values (p &#x3c; 0.0001) were noted in all implanted femora at four months. Bone mineral densities also displayed decreased values after four months of implantation (p &#x3c; 0.0145). Elastic coefficients were consistently less after four months of implantation when compared to control values (p &#x3c; 0.0001). This alteration in material properties would affect load transfer into the implanted femur via the increased disparity between implant and bone stiffnesses regardless of the component design. Significant differences in the elastic coefficients between implanted and control femora support hypothesis 1. However, no group differences were found between collared and collarless implantations; thus, the study does not support hypothesis 2."

			Abstract="A biomechanical study was conducted to determine the best fixation technique for mallet finger fracture among four commonly used methods. Considerations were technical complications, biomechanical properties, and maintenance of reduction. Techniques tested included Kirschner wire, figure-of-eight wire, tension band wire, and tension band suture. Technical complications were frequent with both the Kirschner wire and tension band wire techniques. Biomechanical testing yielded significantly greater energy absorbed to failure and a trend toward greater peak loads to failure for both the figure-of-eight wire and tension band suture techniques. Irreversible loss of reduction during testing occurred in all of the Kirschner wire-fixed fractures, in 60% of the tension band wire-fixed fractures, and in 50% of the figure-of-eight wire-fixed fractures. No irreversible failure occurred in the tension band suture group."

			Abstract="Seven techniques of gluteus medius attachment were compared in vitro in a canine model. Four methods were used for tendon to tendon attachment: (a) two modified Bunnell-Mayer sutures, (b) two Kessler locking loop sutures, (c) two horizontal mattress sutures, and (d) two sutures with a looped suture technique. The two methods of tendon to bone attachment were repair with a 1 cm spiked staple and repair with a spiked washer and screw, and the method of bone to bone attachment involved two figure-eight cerclage wires. The contralateral limb served as a control. Compared with the bone to bone attachment, the four tendon to tendon attachments and the two tendon to bone attachments had significantly less strength (31 and 30% of the ultimate load for bone to bone repair, respectively) and tensile stiffness (24 and 39% of the tensile stiffness for bone to bone attachment, respectively) (p &#x3c; 0.0001). The control specimens were significantly stronger and stiffer than all specimens (p &#x3c; 0.05) except those that had bone to bone fixation. There were no significant differences among the four tendon to tendon suture repairs with regard to either strength or stiffness; the values ranged from 28-45% of those of the controls. Among the tendon to bone repairs, fixation with a spiked washer and screw was significantly stronger than that with a spiked staple (p = 0.032), but there was no difference between these two techniques with regard to stiffness."

			Abstract="The purpose of this study was to determine the respective contribution of each of the following parameters to the compressive, bending, and torsional rigidity of the Kirschner-Ehmer (KE) external fixation splint as applied to canine tibiae with an osteotomy gap: bilateral versus unilateral splints; increasing the number of fixation pins; altering the diameter of fixation pins and side bars; decreasing side bar distances from the bone; increasing pin separation distances in each pin group; decreasing distances between pin groups; altering pin clamp orientation; and altering side bar conformation. Bilateral splints were 100% (mean) stiffer than unilateral splints, with stiffness enhanced to the greatest extent in mediolateral bending and torsion. Increasing pin numbers stiffened both bilateral (mean, 41%; 8 versus 4) and unilateral splints (mean, 14%; 8 versus 4). Medium KE splints were 85% (mean) stiff er than small KE splints. Decreasing side bar distances to the bone from 1.5 cm to 1.0 cm to 0.5 cm increased stiffness of both bilateral and unilateral splints by a mean of 13% to 35%. Widening pin spacing from 1.67 cm to 2.5 cm increased stiffness in craniocaudal bending only (56% increase, bilateral splints; 73% increase, unilateral splints). Decreasing the distance between pin groups from 5.84 cm to 2.5 cm increased stiffness in torsion between 23% (unilateral splints) and 45% (bilateral splints) and decreased stiffness of unilateral splints by 29% in craniocaudal bending. Altering pin clamp configuration so that the bolts of the clamp were inside the side bar rather than outside the side bar increased stiffness in axial compression only (73% increase, bilateral splints; 54% increase, unilateral splints). Conforming the lateral side bar to the tibiae increased only axial compressive stiffness by 77% but was no different than placing the clamps inside the side bars of an unconformed bilateral splint. These results quantify the relative importance of specific parameters affecting KE splint rigidity as applied to unstable fractures in the dog."

			Abstract="An animal model for three-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was established in the goat. Twenty-one goats underwent surgery, with seven goats in each of three experimental groups. In Group I, all seven goats underwent three-level anterior cervical discectomy without fusion. In Group II, each of the seven goats had a three-level discectomy with autogenous bone performed according to the Smith-Robinson technique. In Group III, fresh-frozen allograft bone was used for each of the three-level discectomy and fusion. Each goat was then killed after 12 weeks. Analysis consisted of radiographic review, fluorochrome labeling, biomechanical rigidity and flexion and extension, axial compressive load, and torsion. Histologic analysis was also performed for evidence of fusion and vertebral body histomorphometric analysis. The analysis of results showed that radiographic union was judged to have occurred in 0 of 21 Group I disc spaces, 10 of 21 Group II disc spaces, and 8 of 21 Group III disc spaces. Histologic fusion was judged to have occurred in 0 of 21 Group I goats, 10 of 21 Group II goats, and 0 of 21 Group III goats. The histologic fusion rate was significantly higher in Group II than either Group I or Group III. Biomechanically, the spines that had autogenous bone grafting (Group II) were significantly stiffer in compressive axial load and in extension. Both Group II and Group III were stiffer in flexion than Group I. An evaluation of the peri-endplate vascularity showed that the vascularity measured 10.4% in Group I, 16.7% in Group II, and 8.5% in Group III. This was significantly greater in Group II than in either Group I or Group III. In addition, qualitative analysis of the fluorochrome labeling showed that the autografts had revascularized by 6 weeks in all specimens, whereas only 1 of 21 allograft specimens had revascularized by 6 weeks. By 9 weeks, the allografts had revascularized. In this model using three-level anterior cervical discectomies and fusions, the authors found that autograft bone led to a significantly higher rate of union than did allograft bone. We believe that the increased rate of union with autograft bone is partly due to an increased vascular response to this bone. This study supports the use of autogenous iliac crest bone grafting over allograft bone grafting for cervical spine fusions."

			Abstract="Under adiabatic (or near adiabatic) conditions a volumetric change in an elastic material will produce a corresponding change in temperature. Based upon this principle, thermographic stress analysis (TSA) measures changes in surface heat flux (which are related to changes in surface temperature) and relates them to a coupled form of strains or stresses. To demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique for biomechanical applications, we thermographically measured heat flux from loaded specimens of cortical bone and correlated the results with strain gage data. Regular parallelepipeds were cut from the cortex of bovine femora and loaded sinusoidally at 20 Hz. At this rate of loading, mechanically induced changes in surface temperature could be sampled (via heat flux) prior to a measureable attenuation of the thermoelastic effect. Correlation coefficients demonstrated a significant linear relationship between TSA and measured and computed mechanical parameters (stress, strain, first strain invariant, and strain energy density). TSA therefore appears to be a promising technology for experimental stress analysis in cortical bone."

			Abstract="A canine hip replacement model was used to compare fixation stability in cemented and cementless femoral components. Parameters of comparison were the load-induced positional changes of each prosthesis relative to its proximal femoral cortex, hereafter called relative displacements. Identical femoral components, with the proximal third of their stem porous-coated, were implanted in the right femurs of 10 large, mixed-breed dogs. Five were tightly fit to allow porous ingrowth, and five were cemented into the medullary canal. Four months after implantation, all femurs were harvested. A prosthesis was implanted in the left (normal) femur of each dog ex vivo with fixation identical to the contralateral limb to simulate acute postoperative fixation. Eddy current transducers measured relative displacements under application of static loads, serially applied in the axial, mediolateral, and craniocaudal directions. Thereafter, the femurs were transversely sectioned and morphologically analyzed to correlate bony apposition at the implant surface with relative displacements. We observed no difference in relative displacements between acute and 4-month-cemented groups (e.g., 0.0059 +/- 0.0021 vs. 0.0060 +/- 0.0048 mm, respectively, for 100-N axial loading measured at midstem). With cementless implantation, relative displacements of the acute group were significantly larger (p = 0.007) than those of the 4-month group (e.g., 0.236 +/- 0.257 vs. 0.097 +/- 0.129 mm, respectively, for 100-N axial loading measured at midstem). Cementless components implanted for 4 months were not significantly different than cemented components, but a trend suggested that they were still not as stable as cemented components, particularly for craniocaudal loads. Relative displacements of the 4-month, porous ingrowth group were approximately proportional to the percentage of bony apposition raised to the -1.44 power (r = 0.94)."

			Abstract="A device has been designed and fabricated to measure the cross-sectional area of soft connective tissues ex vivo. It consists of two displacement transducers; one sensing tissue thickness and the other sensing width. Outputs are recorded (via an analog to digital interface) using a personal computer. Numerical integration of a thickness versus width plot computes cross-sectional area. This plot also provides a quality check of acquired data. This device has been successfully used in biomechanical studies of rabbit patellar tendons, rat medial collateral ligaments, and disected specimens of human fascia."

			Abstract="Seventeen 5 to 6-month-old Holstein heifer calves were divided into three groups and fed either a control ration alone or a control ration with sufficient sodium fluoride added to furnish an additional 30 or 50 p.p.m. fluoride based on total dry matter intake. After 6 years of the feedings, mean (SEM) fluoride concentrations in the metacarpals were found to be 594.6 (66.2), 2663.8 (319.2), and 4500.0 (417.8) p.p.m. Bone mineral density and mechanical evaluations were also conducted on the harvested metacarpals after the 6-year period. Using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, mean (SEM) bone mineral densities of 3.030 (0.26), 2.801 (0.34), and 2.456 (0.19) g cm-2 for the control group, the group receiving 30 p.p.m. fluoride, and the group receiving 50 p.p.m. respectively were found. For the mechanical testing, specimens were cut and tested in compression parallel to the long axis of the metacarpals. Mean (SEM) ultimate stress of 204.53 (3.63), 208.83 (5.25), and 205.93 (5.12) MPa and mean (SEM) Young&#x27;s elastic moduli of 20.82 (1.52), 22.68 (2.38), and 21.55 (1.60) GPa for the control, the 30 p.p.m., and the 50 p.p.m. fluoride groups respectively were determined. No significant differences were found between control and treatment groups for either mechanical properties or bone mineral density."

			Abstract="Intersegmental forces and moments (i.e. resultant free body forces and moments computed at the joint centers) were studied in canine hindlimbs before and after cemented total hip replacement (THR). Five large, adult, mixed-breed dogs were selected. Their gait was recorded (while leash-walked) before surgery using high-speed cinematography and a force plate. Cemented total hip replacement was unilaterally performed on each dog. Gait was again recorded at one and four months after surgery. Segmental properties (mass, center of mass, and mass moment of inertia) of the hindlimbs were experimentally determined, and an inverse dynamics approach was used to compute intersegmental forces and moments in the sagittal plane. Significant reductions in intersegmental joint forces and moments were observed in the operated hindlimb one month after surgery, although kinematic gait parameters were unaltered. Decreases of 77.0% for vertical forces, 61.9% for craniocaudal forces, and 66.2% for extension moments were determined. Four months after surgery, the joint forces and moments had returned to their preoperative values. This experiment demonstrates that the dynamics of normal walking can be restored in a canine model by four months after THR. It also shows that kinetic (rather than kinematic) parameters are more descriptive of antalgic gait in the canine."
