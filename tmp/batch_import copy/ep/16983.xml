			Abstract="The U.S. Department of Energy has identified the supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) as one of the concepts for study in the Generation IV advanced reactor program. Advantages of using supercritical water as coolant and moderator include higher thermal efficiency and plant simplification. However, materials corrosion will be an important consideration in SCWRs because of the high temperatures and the oxidative nature of supercritical water. Considerable insight can be gained by examining corrosion in alloys that have been exposed for extended periods in supercritical water fossil fuel power plants many of which have been in operation for over four decades.

			Abstract="The behavior of supercritical (SC) fluid during a blowdown is under investigation. A model based on a steady state Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM) and conditions with and without friction is presented. Calculations indicating three different possible regimes in a blowdown scenario are calculated with this model. The single-phase flow in the supercritical region and the transition either into sub-cooled water, a two-phase fluid or a superheated gas near the critical point results in an interesting flow with a wide range of behavior. Depending on the initial conditions and the geometry either vaporization or condensation can occur either in the pipe or at the exit. In addition, these results are to be extended to other fluids like CO 2 R22 or R134a by comparing thermodynamic properties and their dynamic evolution to dimensionless SC water results. Finally the design of an experiment with initial data on the depressurization of a supercritical water system is presented."

			Abstract="The ex-vessel strategy presumes a failure of the reactor pressure vessel. To achieve coolability, water needs to be present in the reactor cavity as a heat transfer medium to the ultimate heat sink. The controlled interaction and mixing of high-temperature melt and water is the important technical issue in the safety assessment of water-cooled reactors to achieve core coolability. Results of the heat transfer behavior and the stabilizing effect of noncondensable gas addition and system pressure is presented. Tests show that increasing noncondensable gas flow rate and increasing system pressure tend to stabilize the flow without a significant decrease in heat transfer for low water flow rates. The effect of gas injection and increased system pressure is negligible"

			Abstract="A thermodynamically consistent and fully conservative (TCFC) treatment of contact discontinuities (designated as TCFC model in this paper) is proposed for the simulation of compressible multicomponent flows with shock-interface interactions, yielding an accurate capture of contact discontinuities. Starting from the total energy equation of the mixture, a new formulation is developed to define the ratio of specific heats of the mixture, and a governing equation in conservative form for the pressure is subsequently obtained. Another formulation is derived to determine the molecular weight of the mixture from classical thermodynamics. The governing equations in conservative form are further derived to calculate the specific heat ratio and the molecular weight of the mixture with their new formulations and the continuity or mass fraction equations for the individual components. Finally, the governing equations for the ratio of specific heats, the molecular weight and the pressure, combined with the continuity and momentum equations, offer the new hyperbolic conservation laws for the description of multicomponent or multifluid flows with shock-interface interactions. A simple version of the model is also developed without solving the governing equation for the molecular weight of the mixture. A brief analysis of the numerical uncertainties of conventional conservation models and the present TCFC models is presented and the consistency of any additional equation derived within any model with the initial governing equations is investigated. An analysis of the proposed TCFC model and the conventional conservative models is also performed on the pressure evolution for a mixture associated with isolated contact discontinuities. The results show that the present TCFC model produces a uniform pressure field and thus the pressure is maintained in equilibrium across the material interfaces. The proposed TCFC model is then implemented into a Godunov-type method based upon a fast, exact Riemann solver. Several multicomponent flow problems with both strong and weak shocks are simulated using this new model and conventional conservation models, and comparisons of the numerical results from the various models and, where possible, exact solutions are performed. It is shown that the proposed TCFC model can handle both strong and weak shocks, and that the numerical solutions are completely oscillation-free through the contact discontinuities. This new approach offers a suitable treatment of contact discontinuities for compressible multicomponent flows and also maintains all the favorable features of fully conservative conservation laws. It belongs to the conservative approaches and is independent of numerical schemes. From the analysis of the numerical uncertainties of several models proposed in the past and the present numerical experiments, it is determined that the conservative or nonconservative form of some additional governing equations is not the ultimate reason that produces oscillating solutions near the material interfaces. The main cause of the oscillating solutions with conventional conservation models is the inappropriate determination of the ratio of specific heats of the mixture. Oscillation-free results are obtained for two test cases with weak shocks even with conventional conservation models using the present Godunov-type method based on a fast exact Riemann solver. This suggests that the problems with weak shocks and strong post-shock contact discontinuities are not suitable for the model validation in multicomponent flows. The capability of handling strong shocks and weak post-shock contact discontinuities is more critical to the demonstration of any model for compressible multicomponent or multifluid flows"

			Abstract="The use of undergraduate minors to meet national needs in nuclear fission power engineering is discussed. The program would augment conventional undergraduate engineering degree programs with a four-course sequence offered in the junior and senior years, accompanied by a summer practicum The paradigm of certificate-credentialed minor concentrations would be useful in engineering education for addressing the needs for engineers traied in other highly specialized areas such as power systems engineering, integrated manufacturing and nanotechnology. An undergraduate minor concentration would allow students to prepare for careers in such fields without sacrificing the broader educational experience and employment opportunities provided by a degree program."

			Abstract="The SnxLiy and PbxLiy, alloys are being considered as liquid breeding materials for fusion reactor applications. Thus, it is important to understand the safety implications associated with inadvertent contact with water used in an indirect cycle. In an effort to study this interaction, experiments have been conducted with these molten alloys when impacted with a vertical 2.4-m-tall column of water at 30 and 60&#x26;deg;C. The qualitative behavior of Sn75Li25 was compared under similar conditions with other candidate molten metals, specifically tin, lead, and a lead-lithium alloy, Pb83Li 17. Multiple pressure spikes were produced with Sn and Pb, while essentially only one initial pressurization followed by a few strongly damped minor peaks was observed with the different alloys containing lithium. Results with tin-lithium are quite similar to pure tin and lead behavior. Dynamic pressure traces from the physical and chemical reactions are discussed and used to compare the energetics associated with the two different alloys. The pressure traces were used to calculate experimental impulses, which represent the energetics of the reactions. The impulse ratio of the experimental and the theoretical values increased in the tests of alloys containing lithium. (Hydrogen production from lithium-water reactions was quite rapid and copious.) In contrast, hydrogen production with tinlithium was modest and quite similar to the lead-lithium alloy. It was found that the metal-water interactions of Pb83Li17 and Sn75Li25 are quite similar and have significantly reduced energetics from those of pure lithium and other reactive metals being considered."

			Abstract="Several advanced fusion reactor design concepts for MFE power generation incorporate liquid metal as a protective layer or heat transfer medium. The presence of high magnetic fields, necessary to confine the plasma fuel in the core region of the device, effect these liquid metal systems. Recently computational methods have just begun to be able to give some insight into the effects of these high magnetic fields on the liquid metal systems, however experimental data is needed to verify the results of the computations and determine feasibility where computational methods are not possible due to computer resources or the lack of suitable models to deal with turbulence suppression. A series of experiments conducted with helium gas injection (16 - 85 cm3/s) through a 1.6 mm injector into a 2.54 cm liquid metal pool (NaK) with a horizontal magnetic field from 0-6T have been conducted to evaluate a particular reactor power extraction process and to serve as a data base for computational comparison."

			Abstract="Micromachined planar orifice nozzles have been developed using MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) technology and tested with commercially produced diesel injection systems. Such a system, properly designed, may have the capability to improve the spray characteristics in DI diesel engines due to improved atomization and fuel-air mixing. To demonstrate this process, 14 microplanar orifice nozzles were fabricated with deep X-ray lithography and electroplating (LIGA) technology. The circular orifice diameters were varied from 40 to 260 microns and the number of orifices varied from one to 169. Three plates with noncircular orifices were also fabricated to examine the effect of orifice shape on spray characteristics. These nozzles were then attached to commercial diesel injectors and the associated injection systems were used in the study of drop sizes. The experiments were carried out at two different injection pressures (around 25 MPa and 80 MPa). Local drop sizes were measured by a laser diffraction technique, and the average drop sizes of the whole sprays were measured by a light extinction technique. The drop sizes were found to depend primarily on the total mass flow area. Coalescence droplet collisions among adjacent sprays were apparent for the multiple orifice nozzles. Nonplanar configurations are under development and may show improved performance"

			Abstract="In this work, Monte Carlo methods are used for the design of highly efficient detector structures for megavoltage X-ray imaging. The detector structures consist of a converter material and an active medium (&#x22;binary&#x22; detector systems). The novel approach is to impose a spatial structure on the converter material that intersperses the active medium and defines the size of a detector cell. The dimensions of these structures have to be optimized with respect to efficiency and spatial resolution. The results show that the quantum efficiency and detective quantum efficiency at zero frequency of such structures surpasse the efficiency of conventional detector structures using the converter material as a buildup layer and depend on the dimensions of the converter structure and the active medium as well as the materials itself. In general, larger converter structures result in a higher efficiency. The detector signal is proportional to the size of the active medium in the cell. However, the size of the structures are limited by the specifications for the desired spatial resolution."

			Abstract="One concept being considered for steam generation in innovative nuclear reactor applications, involves water coming into direct contact with a circulating molten metal. The vigorous agitation of the two fluids, the direct liquid-liquid contact and the consequent large interfacial area can give rise to large heat transfer coefficients and rapid steam generation. For an optimum design of such direct contact heat exchange and vaporization systems, detailed knowledge is necessary of the various flow regimes, interfacial transport phenomena, heat transfer and operational stability. In order to investigate the interfacial transport phenomena, heat transfer and operational stability of direct liquid-liquid contact, a series of experiments are being performed in a 1-d test facility at Argonne National Laboratory and a 2-d experimental facility at UW-Madison. Each of the experimental facilities primarily consist of a liquid-metal melt chamber, heated test section (10 cm diameter tube for 1-d facility and 10 cm&#x26;times;50 cm rectangle for 2-d facility), water injection system and steam suppression tank. This paper is part II which, primarily addresses results and analysis of a set of preliminary experiments and void fraction measurements conducted in the 2-d facility at UW-Madison, part I deals with the heat transfer in the 1-d test facility at Argonne National Laboratory. A real-time high energy X-ray imaging system was developed and utilized to visualize the multiphase flow and measure line-average local void fractions, time-dependent void fraction distribution as well as estimates of the vapor bubble sizes and velocities. These measurements allowed us to determine the volumetric heat transfer coefficient and gain insight into the local heat transfer mechanisms. In this study, the images were captured at frame rates of 100 fps with spatial resolution of about 7 mm with a full-field view of a 15 cm square and five different positions along the test section height. The full-field average void fraction increases rapidly to about 15% in these preliminary tests, with the apparent boiling length of less than 20 cm. The volumetric heat transfer coefficient between the liquid metal and water are compared to the CRIEPI data, the only prior data for direct contact heat exchange for these liquid metal/water systems"

			Abstract="There is significant ongoing research within the APEX project to develop innovative first wall/blanket concepts capable of efficiently extracting useful thermal energy from magnetic fusion devices that can substantially improve the attractiveness of fusion energy systems. Among the several different ideas are solid and liquid wall concepts. One solid wall concept being considered is the EVOLVE concept. This concept relies on liquid lithium filled tungsten trays to act as a heat transfer and tritium breeding media. In this design, liquid lithium flows into tungsten trays and is brought to the saturation temperature by volumetric neutronic heating of the liquid lithium and tungsten trays. The lithium vapor generated could then be used as the heat transfer media for the thermal power cycle. The key to this design is the vaporization and boiling of the lithium in the presence of a strong magnetic fields (~7 T). Initial analysis of the boiling phenomena lead to many questions regarding the void fractions and boiling flow regime (void distribution) that may exist in the trays [Fusion Technol. 39 (2001) 810]. Since it is necessary to know the void fraction and flow regime present during the boiling process to determine the neutronic heating and energy removal capability, experiments have been initiated to examine this issue. This paper presents initial experiments and scaling analysis conducted in a new test section, which provides real time X-ray determination of flow regimes and void fractions within a pool of low-density liquid metal (NaK) during gas injection inside a horizontal magnetic field. Data will be presented from a first series of tests with gas injection of volumetric flow rates from 0 to 5 SCFH (0g&#x3c;0.06 m/s) with no field"

			Abstract="The Supercritical Water (SCW) cooled nuclear reactor is one of the novel reactor design concepts under consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy. An SCW-cooled reactor has some key advantages over light and heavy water cooled reactors and concepts have been developed by Oka et al.(1999). These reactors have the potential of higher thermal efficiency as compared to the current water cooled reactors because of their higher operating temperatures: 40 to 45%. Also, since the coolant operates as a single-phase fluid, several components such as steam generators, recirculation pumps, and steam separators are eliminated, thereby simplifying the nuclear steam supply system as well as the associated power cycle. Moreover, because of the high enthalpy change associated with SCW around the pseudocritical point, the required coolant mass flow rate can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Conversely, there are some anticipated reactor engineering challenges that must be considered. The supercritical water environment may be quite corrosive for current reactor structural components as well as fuel cladding, thereby reducing the selection of suitable materials to withstand the corrosive environment, while maintaining the neutron economy. In addition to the above concern, many investigators have reported an impairment of the heat transfer coefficient under conditions of high heat flux and low mass flow rates"

			Abstract="The fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) phenomenon has received much attention in the nuclear safety research during the past two decades. A good understanding of mechanisms of such FCI processes may be a concern in the evaluation of severe accidents. This paper presents the TEXAS-3D code, a three-dimensional transient fluid model for fuel/coolant interactions analysis developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To validate our code, we considered three standard two-phase flow problems: a classic broken dam flow, a rising bubble flow and a driven cavity flow"

			Abstract="There is significant ongoing research within the APEX project to develop innovative first wall/blanket concepts capable of efficiently extracting useful thermal energy from magnetic fusion devices that can substantially improve the attractiveness of fusion energy systems. Among the several different ideas are solid and liquid wall concepts. One solid wall concept being considered is the EVOLVE concept. This concept relies on liquid lithium filled tungsten trays to act as a heat transfer and tritium breeding media. In this design, liquid lithium flows into tungsten trays and is brought to the saturation temperature by volumetric neutronic heating of the liquid lithium and tungsten trays. The lithium vapor generated could then be used as the heat transfer media for the thermal power cycle. Key to this design is the vaporization and boiling of the lithium in the presence of a strong magnetic fields ( [similar to] 7 T). Initial analysis of the boiling phenomena lead to many questions regarding the void fractions and boiling flow regime (void distribution) that may exist in the trays [Fusion Technol. 39 (2001) 810]. Since it is necessary to know the void fraction and flow regime present during the boiling process to determine the neutronic heating and energy removal capability, experiments have been initiated to examine this issue. This paper presents initial experiments and scaling analysis conducted in a new test section, which provides real time X-ray determination of flow regimes and void fractions within a pool of low-density liquid metal (NaK) during gas injection inside a horizontal magnetic field. Data will be presented from a first series of tests with gas injection of volumetric flow rates from 0 to 5 SCFH (0 less than or equal Jg less than or equal 0.06 m/s) with no field. &#x26;copy; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

			Abstract="Experiments were conducted to estimate the volumetric heat transfer coefficient associated with direct contact water/liquid metal heat transfer. Although volumetric heat transfer coefficients estimated for the evaporation zone in the UW and ANL facilities were consistent, an order of magnitude were found to be lower than those estimated by CRIEPI for similar superficial velocities. The differences seem to be larger than the error associated in assuming a mixing volume and may be due to the differences in liquid metal temperatures as well as the boiling regime present in the pool."

			Abstract="Dynamic X-ray imaging of fuel-coolant interactions (FCI), including quantitative measurement of fuel-coolant volume fraction and length scales, has been accomplished with a novel imaging system at the Nuclear Safety Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The imaging system consists of visible-light high-speed digital video, low-energy X-ray digital imaging, and high-energy X-ray digital imaging subsystems. The data provide information concerning the melt jet velocity, melt jet configuration, melt volume fractions, void fractions, and spatial and temporal quantification of premixing length scales for a model fuel-coolant system of molten lead poured into a water pool (fuel temperatures 500 to 1000 K; jet diameters 10 to 30 mm; coolant temperatures 20 to 90&#x26;deg;C). Overall results indicate that the FCI has three general regions of behavior, with the high fuel-coolant temperature region similar to what might be expected under severe accident condition. It was observed that the melt jet leading edge has the highest void fraction and readily fragments into discrete masses, which then subsequently subdivide into smaller masses of length scales less than or equal 10 mm. The intact jet penetrates less than or equal 3 to 5 jet length/jet diameter before this breakup occurs into discrete masses, which continue to subdivide. Hydrodynamic instabilities can be visually identified at the leading edge and along the jet column with an interfacial region that consists of melt, vapor, and water. This interface region was observed to grow in size as the water pool temperature was increased, indicating mixing enhancement by boiling processes."

			Abstract="The imaging of photons ranging in energy from a few hundred keV to many MeV finds numerous applications in nuclear engineering and medical physics. Examples include the characterization of nuclear waste and the imaging of nuclear weapons. Acquisition of computed tomography images allows a three-dimensional rendering of the object imaged. In radiation therapy the imaging of high-energy photons is used for patient setup verification and treatment monitoring to guarantee an accurate dose delivery to the target volume. Current detector systems suffer from a low detection efficiency. An increase in the efficiency would decrease the acquisition time and, in radiation therapy, would reduce the dose to the patient. Alternatively, the image quality could be improved for a given dose. This work investigates a new approach of imaging with megavoltage photons. To increase the efficiency, a sufficient amount of metal, together with the interspersed signal-generating medium, is placed along the direction of the photon beam. A significant number of photons interact in the metal and produce high-energy electrons that deposit their energy in the signal-generating medium. A first prototype, consisting of a single detector element, was tested. The extension to a two-dimensional array was investigated with Monte Carlo simulations"

			Abstract="Micro-machined planar orifice nozzles have been developed and used with commercially produced diesel injection systems. Such a system may have the capability to improve the spray characteristics in DI diesel engines. The availability of a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems) processing sequence supported the construction of micro-planar orifice nozzles, and micro-systems technology was also employed in our macro-instrumentation. To demonstrate this process, fourteen MEMS nozzles were fabricated with deep X-ray lithography and electroplating technology. The nozzles are made of 78% nickel and 22% iron alloy. The circular orifice diameters were varied from 40 to 260 microns and the number of orifices varied from one to 169. Three plates with non-circular orifices were also fabricated to examine the effect of orifice shape on spray characteristics. These nozzles were then attached to commercial injectors and the associated injection systems were used for the spray experiments. Given these novel injection systems, jet spray characteristics of micro-machined nozzles were investigated experimentally at two different injection pressures (around 25 MPa and 80 MPa). Local drop sizes were measured by the laser diffraction technique, and the average drop sizes of the whole sprays were measured by the light extinction technique. Current test results show expected qualitative trends in spray kinematics and drop size, but the quantitative magnitudes of the behavior are less dependent on geometry than first anticipated. The spray kinematics and drop sizes were found to depend primarily on the total mass flow area regardless of single or multi-hole or different orifice shape. Non-planar configurations are under development and may show improved performance."

			Abstract="Vapor explosions are processes involving significant energy exchange between a hot and colder, more volatile liquid. This phenomenon can cause significant pressurization and may cause damage to structures. Historically, vapor explosions have been of interest in industrial processes with molten metals, and postulated accident scenarios involving molten fuel and water in current light water reactors. With the potential use of superconducting magnets in fusion designs, postulated accident scenarios involving water used to cool various structures and cryogenic materials (i.e., helium and nitrogen) required for magnet cooling have to be addressed. A rapid increase in pressure may be seen if liquid nitrogen or helium comes into contact with water. Because of significant temperature differences between the water and cryogenic materials, a rapid heat transfer event similar to a vapor explosion may be observed with the cryogen as the &#x27;coolant&#x27; and the water as the &#x27;fuel&#x27;. Experiments to quantify this phenomenon were performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This paper reviews these experiments and presents comparison analyses using the systems code, MELCOR. Experimental results showed that no large &#x27;shock&#x27; pressures were observed. Thus, one can consider the &#x27;fuel-coolant&#x27; interaction to be a boiling event controlled by &#x27;bulk thermodynamics&#x27;. We hope to benchmark the code and show its usefulness in determining potential critical issues involving these fusion systems."

			Abstract="Multi-dimensional modelling of multiphase flows has become more prevalent as computer capabilities have significantly expanded. Such analyses are necessary if the flow physics demonstrates behavior that is fundamentally different from the estimates of one-dimensional analyses. Multiphase multi-dimensional behavior may involve physical mechanisms that interact with the flow field transverse to the main fluid direction and feedback into downstream processes. Consider the physics of high-speed internal nozzle flow, downstream external jet flow and the dynamics of jet breakup. This is a prime example of a coupled problem where multi-dimensional aspects may need to be considered. This paper examines multiphase physics as an illustration of the conditions under which multi-dimensional modelling would be required. Internal nozzle flow can involve cavitation phenomena, and as the geometry becomes more abrupt or asymmetric, multi-dimensional modelling is required. High-speed simulations using our internal flow model, CAVALRY, indicate that cavitation behavior can become oscillatory as the nozzle shape is altered. This exiting internal flow emerges as a multi-dimensional external jet flow, whose downstream breakup can be noticeably influenced by the inlet conditions as well as the jet breakup mechanisms. Jet breakup models first developed for the TEXASV model are utilized in the multi-dimensional KIVA code simulations for gas-liquid flows. The simulation results suggest that similar jet breakup mechanisms are operative for a multi-fluid system. Our comparisons to particular sets of data for high-speed nozzle flow and jet breakup in a gas suggest that the approach can be extended to multiphase systems using similar concepts; i.e. TEXAS-3d. &#x26;copy; 2001 Professor Michael Corradini.

			Abstract="A visualization method is being used to investigate features of nucleate boiling in narrow channels of liquid nitrogen. The information regarding bubble size, departure frequency, bubble spacing, and velocity will be used to develop an analytical model for critical heat flux (CHF) - especially its dependence in narrow channels on inclination angle and gap spacing. We report on the use of a glass fiber bundle combined with two different photographic and illumination techniques to study the desired bubble characteristics. The special considerations encountered with this approach at liquid nitrogen temperature are highlighted, including the use of submerged light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for illumination. &#x26;copy; 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

			Abstract="In order to determine whether the EVOLVE fusion blanket design is viable, thermal-hydraulic analyses were performed on the outboard liquid lithium blanket trays. Various methodologies were employed to determine the vapor fraction distribution within these liquid metal trays. Detailed analysis of the vapor fraction is required for understanding of neutron streaming and for heat removal issues involving the liquid lithium trays. The effect of the magnetic field on the liquid lithium pool is still not fully understood and can strongly influence the potential mode of heat removal. Vapor fractions may be greater than 50% for negligible magnetic coupling between the system and the liquid lithium pool. If the magnetic field is coupled to the liquid lithium pool smaller vapor fractions are predicted, ranging up to 12%. Experiments are proposed to determine the magnitude of this coupling and ultimately the vapor fraction distribution of the liquid lithium pool."

			Abstract="SnxLiy and PbxLiy eutectic alloys are being considered as liquid breeding materials for nuclear fusion applications. Thus, it is important to understand the interactions that might occur if this alloy were inadvertently to contact water. In an effort to study this interaction, experiments have been conducted with the molten alloys when impacted with a vertical 2.4 m tall column of water at 30&#x26;deg;C. The qualitative behavior of Sn75Li25 was compared with similar impacts of other candidate molten metals, specifically a lithium-lead alloy, Pb83Li17. Multiple pressure spikes were produced with Sn and Pb, while essentially only one initial pressurization followed by a few strongly damped minor peaks were observed with the different lithium alloys. Hydrogen production from the lithium water interaction was measured and used to determine the extent of the chemical reaction. Dynamic pressure traces from the physical and chemical reactions are discussed and used to compare the energetics associated with the two different eutectics. It was found that the water/eutectic interactions of Pb83Li17 and Sn75Li25 are quite similar and significantly reduced from that of pure lithium and other reactive metals."

			Abstract="To introduce all first-year students to engineering so that they can make informed career decisions, the University of Wisconsin - Madison, College of Engineering introduced the LINKS program during fall, 2000. Entry-level students had the option of joining the LINKS program that fosters collaboration and creative connections among students, courses, and faculty. Preliminary results indicate that the LINKS program is having both educational and social benefits and may be an effective way to introduce all first-year students to engineering and to provide a sense of community and belonging that is rare on such a large campus."

			Abstract="Highly efficient photon detectors play a major role in countless applications in physics, nuclear engineering, and medical physics. In nuclear engineering, radioactive waste can be characterized with techniques such as the nondestructive assay technique (PNDA). In medical physics, photon detectors are extensively used for diagnostic X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) imaging, nuclear medicine, and quite recently radiation therapy of cancer. In radiation therapy of cancer, ever more accurate delivery techniques spur the need for efficient detectors of the high-energetic photons in the mega-electron-volt energy range in order to allow the imaging of the patient during radiation delivery. In particular, in tomotherapy, a megavoltage detector is used for both CT imaging and verifying the dose received by the patients. Conventional megavoltage detection systems usually suffer from intrinsically low subject contrast. A high signal-to-noise ratio of the detection system can be achieved by keeping the noise as low as possible and/or by increasing the quantum efficiency of the detector. In this work, a candidate of a highly efficient detection system, i.e., an arc-shaped xenon gas ionization chamber, was characterized in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution"

			Abstract="Accidents postulated to occur involving chemical interactions of lithium with water and air are analyzed for the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) blanket test module using two different computer models. Vacuum vessel failure is not predicted for lithium leaks into water, but it is predicted in minutes for water leaks into any amount of lithium if the pressure suppression system fails to work as designed. Calculations for lithium leaks into the reactor vault containing air predict failure in an adiabatic system but not if heat loss is included."

			Abstract="A numerical model that treats liquid and vapor as a continuum has been constructed for predicting small-scale, high-speed, cavitating nozzle flow. In order to model extremely high pressures, the compressibility of both phases has been included in the scheme, and a third-order shock-capturing technique was applied to the continuity equation to capture sharp jumps in density. In addition, a boundary-fitted mesh was used to treat different nozzle geometries. The scheme has been run with very high upstream pressures and with a liquid-to-vapor density ratio of 10,000:1. The model results have been compared to experimental measurements of single bubble collapse. Results are also presented for rounded and sharp nozzle entrances with varying upstream pressures. The model successfully predicted coefficient of discharge and exit velocity for a variety of nozzle geometries."

			Abstract="We have developed a simple and inexpensive encapsulated mechanical impactor that can be operated under water. The unit reproducibly generates upward-directed pressure transients in the water with peaks of approximately 0.13 MPa measured 100 mm above its surface. These pulses have been used to trigger steam explosions of drops of a molten ferrosilicon alloy when they are either just above the unit in free fall through the water or shortly after they land on its surface. The impactor is sturdy, reliable, safe, and environmentally neutral and resets for reuse within seconds. Compared to other triggering techniques, the impactor does not generate light, bubbles, or strong water motion that obscure or appreciably affect the initiation or early stages of the steam explosions. This permits good imaging and measurements at essentially all times during the triggering and subsequent development of the explosions."

			Abstract="Past safety analyses considered the hazard from vapor explosions in a conservative manner where engineering judgement and conservative analyses were used to estimate the likelihood of nuclear reactor containment failure from explosion-induced missile generation [alpha-mode failure]. However, recent safety analyses may require less conservative methods to determine the hazard from vapor explosions; thus, one may need to consider more detailed scaling of vapor explosion energetics, considering fuel-coolant mixing and explosion propagation. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is supporting a coordinated set of experiments to address this issue, given a lack of appropriate benchmark data and associated analyses. These experiments, KROTOS, WFCI and ZrEX are mutually complimentary and provide the first consistent set of data for FCI phenomena under controlled conditions for a wide range of simulant materials that approximate the fuel melt. The scaling logic for these tests is that essentially one-dimensional geometry with rigid constraints would maximize the explosion energetics for a given set of mixing conditions. Thus, only variations in the axial boundary conditions and fuel-coolant initial conditions (mass, composition and temperatures) can affect the mixing and energetics. Our hypothesis is that clear limits to energetics below thermodynamic values can be identified for these high temperature fuel melts along with fundamental understanding, which can aid in issue resolution"

			Abstract="Because an energetic fuel-coolant interaction may be a safety hazard, experiments are being conducted to investigate the fuel-coolant mixing/quenching process [FARO] as well as the energetics of vapor explosion propagation for high temperature fuel melt simulants [KROTOS, WFCI, ZrEX]. In both types of experiments, the dynamic breakup of the fuel is one of the key aspects that must be fundamentally understood to better estimate the magnitude of the mixing/quenching process or the explosion energetics. To aid our understanding the TEXAS fuel-coolant interaction computer model has been developed and is being used to analyze these experiments. Recently, the models for dynamic fuel fragmentation during the mixing and explosion phases of the FCI have been improved by further insights into these processes. The purpose of this paper is to describe these enhancements and to demonstrate their improvements by analysis of particular JRC FCI data"

			Abstract="Stratified Fuel-Coolant Interaction (FCI) experiments with Refrigerant-134a and water were performed in a large-scale system. Air was uniformly injected into the coolant pool to establish a pre-existing void which could suppress the explosion. Two competing effects due to the variation of the air flow rate seem to influence the intensity of the explosion in this geometrical configuration. At low flow rates, although the injected air increases the void fraction, the concurrent agitation and mixing increases the intensity of the interaction. At higher flow rates, the increase in void fraction tends to attenuate the propagated pressure wave generated by the explosion. Experimental results show a complete suppression of the vapor explosion at high rates of air injection, corresponding to an average void fraction of larger than 30%"

			Abstract="The new AP600 reactor designed by Westinghouse uses a passive safety system relying on heat removal by condensation to keep the containment within the design limits of pressure and temperature. Even though some research has been done so far in this regard, there are some uncertainties concerning the behavior of the system under postulated accident conditions. In this paper, steam condensation onto the internal surfaces of the AP600 containment walls has been investigated in two scaled vessels with similar aspect ratios to the actual AP600. The heat transfer degradation in the presence of noncondensable gas has been analyzed for different noncondensable mixtures of air and helium (hydrogen simulant). Molar fractions of noncondensables/steam ranged from (0.4-4.0) and helium concentrations in the noncondensable mixture were 0-50% by volume. In addition, the effects of the bulk temperatures, the mass fraction of noncondensable/steam, the cold wall surface temperature, the pressure, noncondensable composition, and the inclination of the condensing surface were studied. It was found that the heat transfer coefficients ranged from 50 to 800 J s-1 K-1 m-2 with the highest for high wall temperatures at high pressure and low noncondensable molar fractions. The effect of a light gas (helium) in the noncondensable mixture were found to be negligible for concentrations less than approximately 35 molar percent but could result in stratification at higher concentrations.

			Abstract="The thermal interaction of certain molten materials such as Al[vv 2]O[vv 3] with water results in vapor explosions with very high (supercritical) pressures and propagation velocities. A quasi-steady-state analysis and a transient analysis of a supercritical vapor explosion in one-dimensional multiphase flow were applied to analyze experimental data of an Al[vv 2]O[vv 3]-water fuel/coolant interaction obtained from the KROTOS 26, 28, 29, and 30 tests. The shock adiabatic thermodynamic model and the TEXAS mechanistic model were used to perform this analysis. The predicted results of the initial vapor void fraction and explosion conversion ratio from both models, together with the estimated experimental results, for the KROTOS 26 test were compared."

			Abstract="The occurrence of an energetic fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) below the reactor pressure vessel in the cavity of advanced light water reactors (ALWRs) are analyzed to determine the possible hazard to structural walls as a result of dynamic liquid phase pressures. Such analyses are important to demonstrate that these cavity walls will maintain their integrity so that ex-vessel core debris coolability is possible. Past studies that have examined this or related issues are reviewed, and a methodology is proposed to analyze the occurrence of this physical event using the IFCI and TEXAS models for the FCI as well as dynamic shock wave propagation estimates using hand calculations as well as the CTH hydro model. Scenarios for the ALWRs are reviewed, and one severe accident scenario is used as an example to demonstrate the methodology. Such methodologies are recommended for consideration in future safety studies. These methodologies should be verified with direct comparison to energetic FCI data such as that being produced in KROTOS at the Joint Research Centre, Ispra."

			Abstract="Existing models for cavitating flow are extended to apply to discharge of hot liquid through nozzles. Two types of models are considered: an analytical model and a two-dimensional numerical model. The analytical model of cavitating nozzle flow is reviewed and shown to apply to critical nozzle flow where the liquid is subcooled with respect to the downstream conditions. In this model the liquid and vapor are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. The success of this analytical model suggests that hydrodynamic effects dominate the subcooled nozzle flow. For more detailed predictions an existing multi-dimensional cavitation model based on hydrodynamic non-equilibrium is modified to apply to discharge of hot liquid. Non-equilibrium rate data from experimental measurements are used to close the equations. The governing equations are solved numerically in time and in two spatial dimensions on a boundary fitted grid. Results are shown for flow through sharp nozzles, and the coefficient of discharge is found to agree with experimental measurements for both subcooled and flashing fluid"

			Abstract="It has been recognized that the potentially explosive interaction between molten core materials, which are partially metallic, and coolant is a concern in the risk assessment of severe nuclear reactor accidents. Such an interaction can produce steam and hydrogen at rapid rates by steam oxidation of the metallic content of the melt, and potentially a large release of mechanical energy. At present, the role hydrogen generation plays in the fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) process has not been well understood. Experimental studies have been done and simple models developed for hydrogen generation based on empirical data, with a few studies modeling the FCI process with hydrogen generation. This paper presents a physical model for simulating FCI processes in TEXAS-V with chemical reactions. Such a model can achieve a better understanding of the role played by metal oxidation in experiments during the FCI processes of premixing, triggering, and explosion phases"

			Abstract="In a postulated reactor accident, the loss of coolant results in a release of high-temperature steam into the containment. Under these circumstances, steam condensation onto containment walls provides an effective mechanism of energy removal. However, the presence of noncondensable gas is known to degrade the heat transfer. It has also been found that the introduction of a light noncondensable gas has little effect until sufficient quantities are present to disrupt the buoyancy forces. Our investigation shows the dramatic effect of high concentrations of light gas, decreasing steam condensation rates under anticipated accident conditions for AP600, with helium as the simulant for hydrogen"

			Abstract="Because water-cooled molten Pb-17 A/O Li eutectic is being considered as a breeder/blanket for nuclear fusion, we must understand the interactions that occur if this alloy inadvertently contacts liquid water. We have, therefore, compared the behaviour of 120 g of the molten alloy with that of 140 g of molten lead, both at 600&#x26;deg;C when impacted with a vertical 2.4 m-tall column of water at 25&#x26;deg;C or 60&#x26;deg;C. (Temperatures and weights are nominal.) The intent of this study was to determine differences between the fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) behaviours of a chemically reactive melt, the PbLi alloy, and of an inert material, Pb. H2 and aqueous solutions of LiOH, both potentially hazardous, were generated with the alloy, but not with the Pb. Although significant chemical reaction occurred with the alloy, no augmentation of the energetics was measured nor was there any indication of runaway metal ignition. The observations can be interpreted as the typical FCI phenomena seen in shock tube geometry, i.e., hydrodynamic forced mixing of melt by water column impact driving thermal interaction at the melt-water interface. Chemical reactions seem to follow this melt-water contact, moderating, not augmenting, the energetics"

			Abstract="A new facility has been developed to study the explosive interactions of gas-water injection into a molten tin pool. The experimental apparatus allows for variable nitrogen gas and water injection into the base of a steel tank containing molten tin. A first set of experiments based on gas injection only, has been used to develop a diagnostic technique using real-time high energy X-rays to observe the mixing process and measure local and average void fraction in the test section. Void fraction measurements with superficial gas injection rates of 7.0 cm/sec to 14 cm/sec into an 8 cm deep pool of 683 K molten tin, indicate that the average void fraction at these gas injection rates is relatively constant, in the range of 36% to 40%. Similar injections into a pool of 14 to 15 cm depths exhibited void fractions in the range of 18% to 23%. Initial experiments with simultaneous water and nitrogen gas injection have demonstrated the ability to produce energetic interactions in the coolant injection geometry with water flow rates of 0.8&#x26;times;10-2 kg/sec to 2.5&#x26;times;10-2 kg/sec"

			Abstract="Experimental observation has shown that the assumption of complete fuel fragmentation in a vapor explosion by the shock adiabatic thermodynamic model results in predicting upper bounds for the shock pressure, propagation velocity, and work output. This model has been modified by considering the condition where the assumption of complete fragmentation of the fuel is relaxed. A methodology is adopted using experimental values of the shock pressure and propagation velocity to estimate the initial mixture conditions of the experiment and the mass fraction of the materials participating in the explosion. Analysis of a steady-state subcritical vapor explosion in one dimension has been carried out by applying the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy and the appropriate equation of state for a homogeneous mixture of molten tin and water. The KROTOS-21 experiment, conducted at the Joint Research Center at Ispra, Italy, was used as the initial benchmark experiment in this analysis. A quasi-steady explosion pressure of approx. 3 MPa and a propagation velocity of approx. 200 m/s were obtained in this experiment. Using this model, the estimated minimum mass of the fragmented fuel was found to be 0.21 kg. (3.2%) of the total mass of the fuel. The predicted work output by this model corresponding to the aforementioned fragmented fuel mass was found to be 9.8 kJ. The estimated initial void fraction of the vapor was found to be 11.5%. In these analyses, a comparison is made of the various possible closure relations applied to the detonation wave theory for a vapor explosion and associated concerns of model stability in the two-phase region."

			Abstract="To investigate liquid-metal (fuel)/water (coolant) interactions, a vertical shock tube has been designed and constructed. A series of tests was conducted with gallium, indium, lead, and tin as the fuel materials at either &#x27;low&#x27; (Tf approx. 300&#x26;deg;C) or &#x27;high&#x27; fuel temperature (Tf approx. 600&#x26;deg;C), with water at room temperature (low Tc) and in the range of Tc = 56 to 67&#x26;deg;C (high Tc), and with driving pressures from 0.25 to 1.22 MPa. These materials were tested to determine their compatibility for potential use in liquid-metal divertor systems for fusion power plants. The increase in fuel and water temperature, as well as the increase of driving pressure, caused more energetic interactions to occur. High Tf tin and lead interactions, and high Tf and Tc gallium and indium interactions were the most energetic. Stronger interactions produced finer debris fragments. In high Tf gallium and indium interactions, small superficial oxidation was observed. For the first two pulses, larger ratios of compression-(compression of expansion vessel gas) to-expansion work correspond to the experiments with higher fuel and coolant temperatures. For the first pulse, only work ratio values of the most energetic experiments are larger than those of isothermal experiments. Consequently, for such experiments, the impulse values of second pulses are the largest. Higher values of the conversion ratio for the first pulse correspond to more energetic interactions. Even for the most energetic experiments, the conversion ratio is no higher than 1.2%, and no more than 15% (or a few millimetres-thick surface layer) of the initially loaded fuel participated in the interaction, assuming equal initial volumes of fuel and coolant."

			Abstract="Past safety analyses considered the hazard from vapor explosions in a conservative manner where engineering judgement and conservative analyses were used to estimate the likelihood of nuclear reactor containment failure from explosion-induced missile generation [alpha-mode failure]. However, recent safety analyses may require less conservative methods to determine the hazard from vapor explosions; thus one may need to consider more detailed scaling of vapor explosion phenomena. This paper proposes particular scaling considerations for vapor explosions based on recent experimental results and that vapor explosions with prototypic reactor fuel material may be less of a hazard."

			Abstract="A theoretical model has been developed for molten metal/water interactions by using a semiempirical heat transfer correlation and a mass transfer analogy to predict the metal ignition threshold temperatures for aluminum and zirconium. The predictions of the aluminum and zirconium metal temperature responses are studied to identify self-propagating chemical reactions that lead to metal ignition for various metal particle sizes and initial temperatures. The results showed that the ignition of the aluminum metal is possible when the aluminum oxide layer remains in the liquid phase until the metal temperature reaches its oxide layer solidification temperature under highly transient conditions. For both metals, the ignition temperature increased with a larger size of the metal particle, with zirconium requiring qualitatively larger temperatures for ignitions. It was observed that the effect of the water temperature strongly depends on where the chemical reaction front may actually be located."

			Abstract="A two dimensional optical diagnostic technique based on light extinction was improved and demonstrated in an investigation of diesel spray characteristics at high injection pressures.

This technique utilizes high speed photography and digital image analysis to obtain qualitative and quantitative information of the spray characteristics. The injection system used was an electronically controlled common rail unit injector system with injection pressures up to 100 MPa.

Two different injection angle nozzles, 125&#x26;deg; and 140&#x26;deg;, producing an in-plane tilted spray and an out of plane tilted spray were investigated. The experiments were conducted on a constant volume spray chamber with the injector mounted tilted at an angle of 62.5&#x26;deg;. Only one spray plume was viewed, and other sprays were free to inject to the chamber. The spray chamber was pressurized with argon and air under room temperature to match the combustion chamber density at the start of the injection. The experimental results show that the difference in the spray tip penetration length, spray angle, and overall average Sauter mean diameter is small between the in-plane tilted spray and the out of plane tilted spray.

			Abstract="Detonation wave theory was applied to the physical process of a vapor explosion. Initially, our experimental observations using hot water as the fuel and saturated refrigerant liquid as the coolant were analyzed with this technique. These tests are notable since peak explosion pressures were far below the critical pressure of the coolant. From the analysis, the volume fractions of the coolant vapor and the volume ratio of the two liquids prior to the explosion were estimated from the measured peak explosion pressures and associated explosion propagation velocities under the assumption that the process was steady and one-dimensional. Complete Hugoniot curves were constructed, and the detonation condition was initially determined under the assumption that flow velocity behind the shock was equal to the mixture sound speed. This assumption was checked with the tangency condition between the Rayleigh line and Hugoniot curve at the Chapman-Jouguet point, as well as the existence of a minimum in the entropy change across the shock wave. The point of minimum entropy showed good agreement with the graphical tangency point, but was slightly different than the sound speed criteria in pressure (&#x3c;2%) with a larger difference in propagation speed (50%). This discrepancy between the three criteria becomes insignificant as the explosion pressure rises. This is demonstrated by examining a tin-water explosion experiment. This technique appears to be a useful tool to estimate initial conditions for subcritical vapor explosions."

			Abstract="Twenty scoping experiments were performed to investigate the behavior of nominally 0.5 g molten lithium drops when released into 0.7 L of the organic coolant Therminol 66 at local atmospheric pressure using a vortex insertion technique. Diagnostics consisted of video and photographic imaging and several chemical analyses. Six coolant/Li temperature pairs were used: 300/300; 300/530; 300/770; 464/530; 600/530 and 600/770, all nominal in K. Because the coolant: Li weight ratio was 103, only rapid (approx.0.5 s) quenching reactions could be studied when TLi gt; Tc; when TLi  c, however, both rapid and slower (min) interactions could be investigated. In none of the experiments was there any indication of (a) a vigorous, self-sustaining chemical reaction between the lithium and the organic coolant, or (b) the formation of water-insoluble debris, in particular carbon. Our work confirms the benign behavior at similar temperatures reported earlier by others."

			Abstract="Metallurgical observations of boat samples from the TMI-2 pressure vessel suggest a hot spot of approximately one-meter diameter developed on the vessel inner surface during the transient period following core relocation. It was postulated that the hot spot was generated as a result of an impinging jet on the vessel. Calculations have been performed to determine the thermal history of the vessel following jet impingement, accounting for jet breakup during the pour into the lower plenum, the partitioning of energy delivered between the lower plenum water and the vessel lower head, and the growth of crusts and internal convection cells in the relocated debris. Results indicate the hot spot did not evolve from jet impingement. Results from vessel thermal response calculations, which were dominated by input based upon companion-sample examinations, were not consistent with peak temperatures or cooling rates within the hot spot indicated by boat sample examinations"

			Abstract="A vapor explosion is the phenomena in which a hot liquid rapidly transfers its internal energy into a surrounding colder and more volatile liquid. Three series of experiments (WFCI) were conducted to investigate the vapor explosion in 1-D large scale geometry. The first test series was performed to verify experiment reproducibility, the second investigated the spontaneous explosion and the third was conducted to show the effect of an external trigger on the vapor explosion. All the data indicate that the explosion energetics are reproducible for similar initial conditions. Most of the vapor explosions observed in these experiments showed multiple propagations through the fuel-coolant mixture until the mixture expanded against the inertial constraint. However, if the external trigger was strong, the data showed a single explosion. Finally the explosion conversion ratio is measured to be low (less than 1%). This may be explained by the hypothesis that only a small fraction of the fuel is fragmented and quenched on the explosion timescale. Analysis using a C-J detonation model along with debris size distribution are consistent with this hypothesis"

			Abstract="The occurrence of an energetic fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) below the reactor pressure vessel in the cavity of advanced light water reactors (ALWRs) must be analyzed to determine the possible hazard to structural walls as a result of dynamic liquid phase pressures. Such analyses are important to demonstrate that these cavity walls will maintain their integrity so that ex-vessel core debris coolability is assured. This paper reviews past studies which have examined this or related issues and proposes a methodology to analyze the occurrence of this physical event using the IFCI and TEXAS models for the FCI as well as dynamic shock waves propagation estimates using hand calculations as well as the CTH hydro-model. Scenarios for the ALWRs are reviewed and one severe accident scenario is used to demonstrate the methodology. It is recommended that such methodologies be considered in future safety studies and be verified with direct comparison to energetic FCI data"

			Abstract="A methodology has been developed to analyze situations in which a jet of molten material travels through water and impinges upon the surface of a vessel allowing for the eventual formation of melt pool. The methodology included the use of a specific fuel-coolant mixing model, TEXAS, a one dimensional model for the determination of jet conditions which were used in the subsequent one-dimensional phenomenological model for pool heat transfer and vessel heatup. At this time, there is a limited amount of information available about this phenomenon, a few simulant tests exist for such a situation and the comparison with preliminary results seems encouraging. The methodology was applied to the melt relocation event at TMI. The results obtained from a TMI sensitivity analysis, suggest that the scenario that was modeled probably did not cause the local hot spot temperature history as deduced from TMI material samples. A two-dimensional calculational model was developed and predicts a movement of the computed hot spot from an annular ring down to a central hot spot region at the bottom of the pressure vessel. This movement is due to the large heat sink due to the existence of the pressure vessel and water pool above it, and this is in better qualitative and quantitative agreement with available observations."

			Abstract="The energetic FCI has long been recognized as an industrial hazard, and more recently has been considered as a possible hazard during a severe accident in a nuclear power plant. The focus of this paper is on the latter application with specific emphasis on in-vessel and ex-vessel situations in which molten fuel may come into contact with the water coolant. Our focus is twofold; first, to explain the rationale for current research into FCIs and second, to discuss the important multi-phase flow issues that arise from such investigations, particularly experimental. After the many years of research on energetic FCIs there still appears to be three areas where the FCI is important to consider: (1) fuel melt quenching in a water pool, (2) adding water to a degraded core, and (3) FCI energetics. Under current agreements these areas are being actively investigated by researchers in the European community as well as the United States. Such experiments with international cooperation are briefly discussed (e.g., FARO, KROTOS and MACE). In such experiments difficulties arise in measuring the appropriate quantities to characterize the FCI phenomena due to the high transient nature of processes involved. We discuss the important multi-phase flow topics in which further basic research may be needed to aid in FCI model validation of FCI related physical processes, and how these subjects relate to the FCI"

			Abstract="To better understand the fundamental processes of a vapor explosion benchmark experiments are needed to evaluate explosion models for various levels of sophistication. This paper presents the analysis of one particular benchmark experiment, KROTOS-21 performed at JRC Ispra, using two different approaches to model vapor explosion processes. One is a thermodynamic approach that can be used by experimenters directly to analyze explosion data; i.e. based on thermodynamics applied to the explosion process. The second is a more detailed mixing and propagation model, TEXAS III, that considers the transient mixing process and the subsequent explosion escalation and propagation. The former thermodynamic model can be used to estimate the mixing conditions (mass ratio of coolant/fuel, average void fraction) which produce the observable C-J conditions for an equilibrium propagation. The latter transient model can be used to determine the absolute value of these mixing conditions (fuel mass and mixing diameter, local void profile), which may explain the observed detailed propagation behaviour. Because the fragmentation model is semi-empirical a sensitivity study was performed to indicate regions of the model applicability"

			Abstract="The interaction of molten-lithium droplets with water is studied experimentally. In one set of experiments, droplets of approx 10-to 15-mm diameter are injected into a vessel filled with water. The reaction is filmed, and pressure measurements are made. The initial metal and water temperatures range from 200 to 500&#x26;deg;C and 20 to 70&#x26;deg;C, respectively. It is found that when reactant temperatures are high, an explosive reaction often occurs. When the initial lithium temperature is gt;400&#x26;deg;C and the water is gt;30&#x26;deg;C, the explosive reactions become much more probable, with pressure peaks as high as 4 MPa. The reaction id modeled to explain the temperature threshold for this metal-ignition phenomena. Results with the model support the hypothesis that explosive reactions occur when the lithium droplet surface reaches its saturation temperature, while the hydrogen film surrounding the drop is relatively thin. A second set of experiments measures the reaction rate of nonexplosive lithium-water reactions. The test geometry parallels that of the previous experiments, and the reactant temperature combinations are deliberately kept below the observed ignition threshold. Two separate methods are used to determine the reaction rate in each test: One uses a three-color pyrometer to measure the drop temperature as the lithium rises through the water, while the other consists of a photographic technique that measures the amount of hydrogen generated. Measured reaction rates range from approx 10 to 50 mol/ s.m2 with good agreement between the two measurement techniques. The data do not show any significant variation in the reaction rate as a function of either the initial water or initial lithium temperature."

			Abstract="The risk estimate for nuclear power plants is often based on source term calculations done by computationally intensive severe reactor accident simulations. These fluid dynamics codes balance mass, energy, and momentum over a network of control volumes by solving large, coupled sets of ordinary differential equations. Generally, these codes are not run-time optimized and they take no advantage of the advancements in computer architectures such as vector or parallel processing. Most popular examples of these nuclear accident codes are MELCOR and RELAP5. As parallel computing finds its way into production level industrial real-time applications, one wonders what the best simulation model and best architecture are for nuclear applications. Although far from answering such a question, we have conducted research on the parallel performance of 2 major fluid codes, including a non-nuclear 3-D fluid code (KIVA) in addition to MELCOR and HECTR"

			Abstract="An experimental investigation to examine the effects of surface orientation on the condensation of steam in the presence of noncondensable gas is reported. An air-steam mixture was directed into a rectangular flow-channel over a condensing aluminum surface that has a painted surface finish. The mixture flow was concurrent in all the tests with condensate flow. In this series of experiments, the orientation of the condensing surface was varied from 0-90&#x26;deg; (plate surface was facing downwards at 0&#x26;deg;), with a variable air-steam mass fraction of 0-0.87, and a mixture velocity of 1-3 m/s. The heat transfer coefficient was measured in addition to making visual observations of the condensation process. It was found that the heat transfer coefficient varied from 100 to 600 W/m2 K with the mass fraction of 0.87-0.24 and the maximum heat transfer coefficient of 6200 W/m2 K was measured with mass fraction of ~0. By tilting the condensing surface from the horizontal to vertical position, the heat transfer coefficient decreased 15 to 25% depending on the mass fraction. With a higher vapor content the effect of the orientation was smaller. This dependence was attributed to the existence of interfacial structure (droplets and ridges) that promoted heat transfer at small inclination angles, when the angle was increased the interface became smoother and heat transfer rates decreased. Heat transfer rates were also observed to increase with flow velocity, vapor content and pressure. The results are compared with some previously published data and a proposed condensation model that showed reasonable agreement with the data trends"

			Abstract="Time resolved measurements of non-evaporating, non-burning fuel sprays injected into a quiescent atmosphere were performed. The experimental parameters included ambient gas density, mass of fuel injected per stroke, pump speed, and nozzle diameter. High speed films of fuel sprays were obtained using a rapidly pulsed Cu-vapor laser in synchronization with a high frame rate film camera. The laser light intensity transmitted through the spray was recorded directly by the film camera. The information encoded on the film was subsequently digitized using a projector/CCD camera system. Finally, instantaneous ensemble averaged properties of droplets constituting the spray were estimated by quantitative analysis of the digitized transmission images. These measured properties included the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) averaged over the entire spray or over a given cross-section. In addition, the images yielded other spray parameters such as tip penetration, cone angle, and injection duration. The results showed that SMD decreased as injection proceeded. Furthermore, the SMD approached an asymptotic size. Longitudinal variation of SMD at a specific time indicated that the size reached a minimum in the spray interior. These results were compared with other data obtained with a phase-Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA) [1] utilized on the same experimental configuration. Comparison with a breakup model developed at UW-Madison [2] as well as other models was made. The data of this study are in reasonable agreement with both the PDPA data and these spray models."

			Abstract="Investigations are performed to study the mixing between immiscible liquids in a pool configuration due to an upward gas flow. A water-R113 system is used in the bubbly/churn-turbulent regimes to determine the effects of the unagitated pool depth on layer mixing. the superficial gas velocity at which full mixing is attained is observed to increase the pool depth, although it is concluded that this is a weak dependency. Mixing in the churn-turbulent regime is studied with Wood&#x27;s metal-water and Wood&#x27;s metal-silicone fluid (100 cS) as pairs of fluids. Additional past mixing data from six other fluids are also included in the data base. A criterion is proposed to determine if two liquids will entrain in bubbly or churn-turbulent flow. Correlations are derived that, for a set of given conditions, allow prediction of the mixing state (mixed or segregated) of a system. Because of the indirect method of measuring the mixed layer thickness, pool void fraction experiments are also performed. For the case of water and R113, the effect of unagitated pool depth on the void fraction is studied. The drift flux two-phase flow model is used for the analysis of the void fraction experiments, and correlations are proposed to predict the void fraction for both the bubbly and churn-turbulent flow regimes. These correlations take into account the physical properties of the liquid, the unagitated pool depth, and the superficial gas velocity. After comparison with independent data, it is concluded that they are suitable for molten core/concrete interaction modeling in the absence of solid crusts."

			Abstract="A vapor explosion is a physical event in which a hot liquid (fuel) transfers its internal energy to a colder, more volatile liquid (coolant): thus the coolant vaporizes at high pressures and expands and does work on its surroundings. In postulated severe accidents in current fission reactors, vapor explosions are considered if this molten `fuel&#x27; contacts residual water in-vessel or ex-vessel because these physical explosions have the potential to contribute to reactor vessel failure and possibly containment failure and release of radioactive fission products. Current safety analyses and probabilistic studies consider this process with the use of explosion models. Eventually these models must be compared with available experimental data to determine their validity. This study provides a comprehensive review of vapour explosion experiments for eventual use in such comparisons. Also, when there are insufficient data, experiments are suggested that can provide the needed information for future comparisons. This review may be useful for light-water-reactor as well as noncommercial reactor safety studies"

			Abstract="An experimental investigation of stratified vapor explosions and scaling is conducted by constructing test sections of two different sizes and using two different fluid pairs. The horizontal lengths of the interaction vessels are 20 and 50 cm (geometric scale ratio: 2:5). The two liquid pairs are water and liquid nitrogen, and water and Freon-12, with water being the hot liquid. The interactions are either triggered by an external trigger or allowed to occur spontaneously depending on the liquid pair and initial conditions. The major experimental variables are initial water temperature, liquid layer depths, and magnitude of the external trigger pressure. Interaction pressures, mechanical work release, and depth of intermixing are measured. The water/Freon-12 pair produces more violent interactions than the water/liquid nitrogen. In both cases, the explosion propagation speeds are supersonic, ranging from 40 to 250 m/s. The small depths (&#x3c;=1 cm) of liquid-liquid mixing during the explosion propagation are observed in both liquid pairs. A simple model for the depth of intermixing is derived, and the result shows reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The length of the liquid layer interface and the depth of the top liquid appear to be the key geometric parameters in stratified vapor explosions."

			Abstract="An experimental investigation to examine the effect of surface orientation on the condensation of steam in the presence of a noncondensable gas is reported. An air-steam mixture is directed into a rectangular flow-channel over a condensing aluminum surface which has a painted wetting surface finish. In order to simulate a flat plate geometry as closely as possible, measurements were done in the region where flow was still developing. In this series of experiments the orientation of the condensing surface was varied from 0-90&#x26;deg; (plate surface facing downwards to 0&#x26;deg;), with a variable air-steam mass ratio of 0.24-0.8, and a mixture velocity of 1-3 m/s. The heat transfer coefficient was measured as well as making visual observations of the condensation process. The heat transfer coefficient varied from 100 to 600 W/m2K. In comparison to the previous set of experiments with a bare polished aluminium surface the results showed an increase of 50-200% from upward facing bare surface, but lower than the downward facing bare surface more than 30%. The observed differences are attributed to the mode of condensation. A filmwise condensation mode prevailed throughout the current tests. The heat transfer coefficient decreased with the angle and increased with the flow velocity. The results are compared with some previously published data and a condensation model which show reasonable agreement with the data trends."

			Abstract="Experimental work and supporting analysis have been conducted by Westinghouse Hanford Company and the University of Wisconsin on lithium-lead alloy chemical reactivity. This work is in support of the US Department of Energy Fusion Safety Program through EG&#x26;G Idaho Inc. These studies involve experiments with lithium-lead (17Li83Pb) and its interactions with air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, concrete steam and water. The work at Westinghouse Hanford has been done to characterize potential safety concerns associated with the use of this alloy as a breeding and/or coolant material in fusion reactors. These activities primarily involve large and small scale integral experiments. The work at Wisconsin has focused on lithium alloy/water interactions and is concerned with the chemical kinetics in small scale separate effects tests. In addition this work has been complemented by larger scale more prototypic tests and associated analyses at JRC Ispra. The authors discuss recent results and the status of their knowledge"

			Abstract="The vapor explosion process can involve the mixing of fuel with coolant prior to the explosion. A number of analysts have suggested limits to the amount of fuel/coolant mixing that could occur within the reactor vessel following a core melt accident. Past models are reviewed and a simplified approach is suggested to estimate a limit on the amount of fuel/coolant mixing possible. The approach uses concepts first advanced by Fauske in a different way. The results indicate that fuel temperature, ambient pressure and in particular the mixing length scale Dmix are important parameters. For large values of Dmix the fuel mass mixed in-vessel is limited to the range of 1-12 metric tons (1-10% of the core mass.)"

			Abstract="Satisfactory agreement of the theoretical and experimental results of the condensation phenomenon at low pressures and densities has not been achieved. One influence is the presence of noncondensable gases. The general tendency in the modelling of the condensation process is to improve the theoretical models with the aid of the Boltzmann equation set for the vapor/gas mixtures, resulting in the use of simplified mathematical forms of the equation. Another possible technique to solve the problem is to provide a computer analog with an approximate relationship to the real flow which models the physical processes included in condensation without direct reference to the Boltzmann equation. This technique is employed by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The condensation of a monatomic metal vapor at low pressures and densities is studied in the presence of a noncondensable gas with different partial pressures"

			Abstract="A mass transport chemical reaction model is presented for predicting (with the use of experimental data) the rate of hydrogen generation in the interaction of lithium-lead alloy (Li17Pb83) with water. The model is used to determine diffusion-rate constants for the lithium-lead/water interaction. The results from the model indicate that the chemical reaction can be represented by a linear rate law after the initial moments of the reaction (&#x3e;10 s). However, the early stage of the chemical reaction does not follow a linear rate law. The results also indicate that for initial liquid-metal temperatures below 590&#x26;deg;C, the activation energy is not a function of the initial liquid-metal temperature"

			Abstract="Vapor is produced from the ICF event as the x-ray energy is deposited at the first wall of the reactor. This vapor must condense back onto the first wall in a timely fashion (&#x3c;&#x3c; 1 s) to establish the necessary conditions for beam propagation and the next ICF event. Transient condensation of vapor is studied on the basis of the Boltzmann equation using a direct simulation Monte Carlo Method. The method describes the molecular behavior of continuum mechanics transition flows in a way consistent with the Boltzmann equation. The thermal resistance of the condensed film is included in the flow representation using a laminar Nusselt analysis to determine the interface temperature of the condensed film. The condensate mass flux in a quasi-steady state is computed and compared with a number of analytical models and experimental data. The results are consistent qualitatively with the experimental data of mercury condensation on a vertical plate."

			Abstract="In a severe accident in a light water reactor, a molten mixture of fuel and metals could be deposited onto the concrete floor below the vessel. The subsequent molten core-concrete interaction (MCCI) is of concern particularly in its early phase when concrete erosion rates (and associated decomposition gases) and aerosols produced from the reaction may be large. The rate and type of aerosol production is a function of the chemistry between the pool and the decomposition gases released. Both these processes are driven by the hydrodynamics of the molten pool, and the heat transfer between it and the concrete. Recently experiments have begun at Argonne to specifically address the question of aerosol production from the MCCI at early times"

			Abstract="An experimental investigation has begun to examine the effect of surface orientation on the condensation of steam in the presence of a noncondensible gas. An air-steam mixture is directed into a flow-channel over a condensing aluminum surface. In this series of experiments the orientation of the condensing surface was varied from 0-75&#x26;deg; (plate surface facing downwards at 0&#x26;deg;), with a variable air/steam mass ratio of .3-7, and a mixture velocity of 1-3ml/s. The heat transfer coefficient was measured as well as making visual observations of the condensation process. The results showed enhanced heat transfer rates up to three times higher than at the angle of 180$DGR."

			Abstract="A fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) is a phenomenon that may occur during a light water reactor severe accident when molten fuel comes into contact with residual water in-vessel or in the reactor containment. A new one-dimensional mutifluid transient model, which currently has the capability of examining nonexplosive FCI behavior, is described. A unique dynamic fuel fragmentation model based on relative velocities was incorporated into this model along with other constitutive relations. The model was compared to the limited FCI data on mixing and nonexplosive FCI events and shows relatively good agreement. In addition, a set of FCI parametric calculations for in-vessel fuel-coolant mixing was performed to gain insight into the important variable affecting mixing (i.e., pressure, water depth, multiple jets) and the initial conditions for the explosion."

			Abstract="A mass transport chemical reaction model is presented for predicting (with the use of experimental data) the rate of hydrogen generation in the interaction of lithium-lead alloy (Li17Pb83) with water. The model is used to determine diffusion-rate constants for the lithium-lead/water interaction. The results from the model indicate that the chemical reaction can be represented by a linear rate law after the initial moments of the reaction (gt; 10 s). However, the early stage of the chemical reaction does not follow a linear rate law. The results also indicate that for initial liquid-metal temperatures below 590&#x26;deg;C, the activation energy is not a function of the initial liquid-metal temperature."

			Abstract="A series of single droplet vapor explosion experiments were conducted to investigate the suppressive effects on explosion triggering. In these tests laser-melted iron-oxide droplets were injected into a large water pool. The major variables were the coolant viscosity and the external trigger which induces the explosion. Over sixty experiments were conducted. The nominal behavior (&#x26;mu;=0.001 kg/ms) showed the molten iron-oxide droplet entering the water in stable film boiling. When the trigger pressure wave was applied, the vapor film rapidly collapses (0.05 kg/ms) at fixed trigger pressure (and impulse) resulted in complete explosion suppression. As the trigger pressure was increased the explosion could be triggered for intermediate viscosities, but suppression still remained for high viscosities (&#x3e;0.15 kg/ms). The explosion conversion ratio varied from 0-6%"

			Abstract="A vapour explosion is a physical event in which a hot liquid (fuel) rapidly fragments and transfers its internal energy to a colder, more volatile liquid (coolant); in so doing, the coolant vaporizes at high pressures and expands, doing work on its surroundings. In present day fission reactors, if complete and prolonged failure of normal and emergency coolant flow occurs, fission product decay heat would cause melting of the reactor materials. In postulated severe accident analyses vapour explosions are considered if this molten `fuel&#x27; contacts residual water in-vessel or ex-vessel, because these physical explosions have the potential of contributing to reactor vessel failure and possibly containment failure and release of radioactive fission products"

			Abstract="The Ra tandem mirror fusion reactor concept features inherent safety, high net plant efficiency, low cost of electricity, low radioactive waste generation, low activation, highly efficient direct conversion, thin radiation shields, and axisymmetric magnets. The safety and environment features are achieved through the use of D/He-3 fuel, while the high efficiency derived from a novel operating mode ICRF (ion cyclotron range-of-frequencies) stabilization allows an axisymmetric magnet set. The Ra concept requires an economic source of He-3, such as recently proposed lunar resources, and a modest physics extension of the requirements for a deuterium-tritium (D-T) tandem mirror reactor. The three critical technology areas for a Ra-mode reactor are the high-energy neutral beams, fueling, and the high-voltage direct converter."

			Abstract="The vaporization of radioactive materials during molten core concrete interactions has been determined to be an important contributor to the radiological source term in the event of reactor containment failure. Recent experiments have indicated that at modest superficial gas velocities (1-30 cm/sec), the melt may be mixed, as opposed to the stratified geometry previously assumed. The mixing of the melt has important implications for not only the heat transfer process within the melt, but also for the calculation of material vaporization and the chemical composition of the melt. Modifications have been made to the CORCON-Mod2 code to consider the mixing of the melt using results of recent experiments using simulant fluids. Also the vaporization of fission products from the melt in either the stratified or mixed configuration is calculated. The internal thermodynamic data base in CORCON has been updated and the ideal chemical equilibrium model is used to calculate the vaporization of core materials. Kinetic effects have been neglected."

			Abstract="In any attempt to accurately simulate a pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant, a model for the steam generator must be included. This paper presents a theoretical and computer model based on first principles for a vertical U-tube, natural circulation steam generator. The Kewaunee nuclear station&#x27;s Westinghouse steam generators serve as the basis for the geometric and operating parameters of this model. The model has been compared to a series of standard transient tests and comparing the results with previous RETRAN analysis of the same transients. These tests include a 50% load reduction from 100% power, and a reactor trip from 100% power. The development of the model, the test results, the computer code itself, a users&#x27; manual for the computer code, and suggestions for improving the model&#x27;s performance have been included."

			Abstract="A one-dimensional, propagation/expansion model has been developed for large scale vapor explosions based on a fragmentation concept involving film collapse and coolant jet impingement and entrapment. This fragmentation model was combined with the nonequilibrium propagation/explosion model to predict the integral behavior in a vapor explosion such as pressure history and explosion conversion ratio. The model predicts the correct qualitative trends from available explosion data (e. g. , the fully instrumented test series at Sandia National Laboratories) as a function of fuel composition, coolant temperature, ambient pressure, coolant/fuel mass ratio, and initial constraint. Quantitative agreement with data is found to be quite dependent on the initial mixing conditions, i. e. , coolant vapor and liquid volume fractions in the explosion zone. Some of the predicted trends would change when the scale increases."

			Abstract="The Ra tandem mirror fusion reactor concept features inherent safety, high net plant efficiency, low cost of electricity, low radioactive waste generation, low activation, highly efficient direct conversion, thin radiation shields, and axisymmetric magnets. The safety and environment features are achieved through the use of D-3He fuel, while the high efficiency derived from a novel operating mode ICRF (ion cyclotron range-of-frequencies) stabilization allows an axisymmetric magnet set. The Ra concept requires an economic source of 3He, such as proposed lunar resources, and a modest physics extension of the requirements for a deuterium-tritium (D-T) tandem mirror reactor. The three critical technology areas for a Ra-mode reactor are the high-energy neutral beams, fueling, and the high-voltage direct converter"

			Abstract="In a nuclear reactor, the containment represents the final barrier to fission product release following a severe accident. The timing and manner of containment loading are important in determining if a failure occurs and the magnitude of radioactivity release. A variety of computer models have been developed to analyze severe accidents and in particular the containment. Recently, physical processes are of interest involving fuel/coolant interactions, hydrogen combustion, and direct heating following reactor pressure vessel (RPV) breach with containment feedback. Based on this need the HMC code was developed. The authors discuss scoping calculations using HMC to investigate containment loads for the Surry reactor under a variety of parametric boundary and initial conditions (low and high RPV pressures) at the time of vessel breach"

			Abstract="A transient film boiling model was developed to study the film boiling dynamics that would occur when a molten, spherical fuel droplet is immersed in a coolant. The focus of this study was to investigate the effects of noncondensible gas, coolant temperature and ambient pressure on film boiling during the initial growth phase. These parameters were found to have the greatest influence on the triggering of the small scale fuel-coolant interactions. The results indicate that the film generally stabilizes with more noncondensible gas present and higher coolant temperatures. Calculations indicate that small ambient pressurizations cause violent fluctuation of the film pressure while higher ambient pressures suppress these oscillations. These results are in good agreement with Nelson&#x27;s experimental data for a single fuel droplet in water."

			Abstract="Dimensional analysis is applied to Nelson&#x27;s small-scale steam explosion experiments to determine the qualitative effect of each relevant parameter for triggering a steam explosion. According to experimental results, the liquid entrapment model seems to be a consistent explanation for the steam explosion triggering mechanism. The three-dimensional oscillatory wave motion of the vapor/liquid interface is analyzed to determine the necessary conditions for local condensation and production of a coolant microjet to be entrapped in fuel. It is proposed that different contact modes between fuel and coolant may involve different initiation mechanisms of steam explosions."

			Abstract="In the HIBALL heavy ion beam fusion reactor design, the INPORT concept is used to protect the first surface of the reactor from damage by the high energy X-rays, ion debris and fast neutrons from the exploding target. Liquid Li//1//7Pb//8//3 flows through porous SiC tubes and wets outside of the tubes with a layer of Li//1//7Pb//8//3. This Li//1//7Pb//8//3 film is evaporated on each shot by the target X-rays and ion debris. The mechanisms that control the vapor pressure of the chamber are: gas radiation, Li//1//7Pb//8//3 evaporation from the INPORT tubes, and gas condensation back onto the INPORT tubes. From the beam stripping cross section for Bi**2** plus ions on Pb the gas pressure (evaluated at 0 degree C) inside the chamber must be at or below 10** minus **4 torr in order for the ion beam to reach the target and ignite it. The repetition rate is therefore determined by the time required to reestablish this pressure after a shot. Calculations are presented that indicate that this time is short enough to allow a 5 Hz repetition rate for a wide range of parameters."

			Abstract="The vapor explosion process involves the mixing of fuel with coolant prior to the explosion. A number of analysts have identified limits to the amount of fuel/coolant mixing that could occur within the reactor vessel following a core melt accident. Past models are reviewed and a simplified approach is suggested to estimate the upper limit on the amount of fuel/coolant mixing possible. The approach uses concepts first advanced by Fauske in a different way. The results indicate that water depth is an important parameter as well as the mixing length scale D//m//i//x, and for large values of D//m//i//x the fuel mass mixed is limited to less than 7% of the core mass."

			Abstract="If a complete failure of normal and emergency coolant flows occurs in a light water reactor, fission product decay would eventually cause melting of the reactor fuel, leading to contact with water. An energetic fuel/coolant interaction (steam explosion) may result. Experiments were performed at Sandia National Laboratories in which approximately 5 to 20 kg of molten fuel simulant were delivered into water in which the water mass was 1. 5 to 50 times greater than the fuel. These experiments in subcooled and saturated water showed that spontaneous explosions occurred over the range of water/fuel mass ratio and that in certain experiments multiple explosions occurred. The kinetic energy conversion ratio was less than 2%. A model is proposed to describe the fuel/coolant mixing process. The model is compared to these intermediate-scale experiments. Additional data analysis indicates that the steam explosion is affected by the mixing process."

			Abstract="During a postulated loss of coolant accident (LOCA) or a degraded core accident in a light water reactor (LWR), an important concern is to be able to predict the presssure-temperature response in the containment building as steam and possibly gas (e. g. , hydrogen) are injected into it. A condensation model for forced and natural convection is derived by extending the Reynolds-Colburn analogy for heat and momentum transfer to mass and momentum transfer. The model is compared to the steady-state data of Uchida and Tagami and found to be in reasonable agreement with the forced convection data when an imposed velocity of 2 m/s is assumed. The natural convection model has the same functional dependence on Grashof number as the data of Akers."

			Abstract="In a fuel/coolant interaction, interfacial area is the important variable for accurately predicting the steam generation rate; it should be modeled not only for its final drop size or total breakup time but also for the detailed drop size history during breakup. In past experiments, data over a wide range of Weber numbers only measured the total breakup times and final fragment sizes. However, it has been difficult to measure the drop size history experimentally during the breakup process. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to predict theoretically the droplet size history during hydrodynamic breakup"

			Abstract="If complete failure of normal and emergency coolant flow occurs in a light water reactor (LWR), fission product decay heat would eventually cause melting of the reactor fuel and cladding. Suppose the molten fuel has fallen into the coolant and premixed to some specified diameter. When an explosion is triggered, the molten fuel rapidly fragments and transfers its energy to the coolant within a short time (&#x3c;1 s). The subsequent steam explosion depends on the complicated processes of fuel fragmentation and mixing as well as the heat transfer mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to assess the important initial conditions in determining the explosion conversion ratio of fuel thermal energy to mechanical energy steam generation rates, and pressure history with the phenomenological model to better characterize processes during a severe reactor accident"

			Abstract="A transient concrete ablation/decomposition model was derived based on an integral analysis technique for conduction into and decomposition and ablation of the concrete. The resultant model predictions were then compared to concrete erosion data from well-defined separate effect tests and found to be in good agreement, when the assumed polynomial temperature profile was assumed to be quadratic. The model does not properly account for the details of the in-depth evaporable water saturation zone, since it only models the phenomena in an integral sense. This model is simple enough so that it can be incorporated into the larger molten-core/concrete interaction codes to predict concrete erosion rates."

			Abstract="A condensation model for forced and natural convection is derived by extending the Reynolds-Colburn analogy for heat and momentum transfer to mass and momentum transfer. The model is compared to the steady state data of Uchida (1965) and Tagami (1965), and found to be in reasonable agreement with the forced convection data when an imposed velocity of two meters per second is assumed. The natural convection model derived has the same functional dependence on Grashof number (hTOT~Gr-.37) as the data of Akers (1960)"
