			Abstract="A model was developed for predicting the collapse behavior of photoresist structures due to the drying of rinse liquids during wet chemical processing. The magnitude of the capillary forces was estimated using the classical thermodynamics of surface tension, and the deformation of the structure was modeled using beam bending mechanics that accounts for both elastic and plastic modes of deformation. The two-dimensional model can predict the critical beam height of collapse as a function of the wetting behavior of the rinse liquid on the beam, the elastic and plastic mechanical properties of the polymeric photoresist, and the beam dimensions. Collapse behavior was predicted for polymer nanostructures with elastoplastic mechanical properties similar to those of bulk poly(methyl methacrylate). We have compared the collapse predictions from our model with the results of models that account only for elastic or plastic deformation behavior. Regimes in the elastic-plastic mechanical property space for which it is necessary to use the developed beam bending model have been highlighted. It is shown that in some cases the inclusion of both elastic and plastic mechanical properties is necessary for modeling the collapse behavior of polymer beams fabricated using the lithographic process.

			Abstract="A micromechanics-based nonlocal constitutive equation relating the ensemble averages of stress and strain for a matrix containing a random distribution of randomly oriented spheroidal voids or inclusions is derived. The analysis employs J.R. Willis&#x27; generalization of the Hashin-Shtrikman variational formulation to random linear elastic composite materials and builds on that of Drugan and Willis (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 44 (1996) 497) and Drugan (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 48 (2000) 1359), who derived completely explicit results for the case of isotropic, nonoverlapping identical spherical inclusions/voids. The model of impenetrable particles employed consists of identical particles with fixed spheroidal shape and random orientation. To facilitate a manageable statistical description, the spheroids are placed within concentric hard &#x22;security&#x22; spheres. The paper derives three main new results: (i) it is proved within the assumptions just outlined that the effects of inclusion shape and their spatial distribution are separable, for arbitrary inclusion shape (not just spheroids) and arbitrary spatial (statistical) distribution of their security spheres when employing up through two-point statistical information; (ii) closed-form analytical results are obtained from the Verlet-Weis improvement of the Percus-Yevick-Wertheim statistical model of a random distribution of nonoverlapping spherical particles/voids, leading to substantial improvements at higher inclusion/void volume fractions in the nonlocal constitutive equations of Drugan and Willis (1996) and Drugan (2000); (iii) approximate analytical nonlocal constitutive equations are derived for composites consisting of a matrix containing randomly oriented oblate or prolate spheroidal inclusions/voids, using the Verlet-Weis statistical model for the security sphere distribution. Among the specific implications of these new results, it is found that the minimum representative volume element (RVE) size estimate for composites containing spherical inclusions/voids using the Verlet-Weis improvement is significantly larger at higher inclusion/void volume fractions ( approximate to 0.3-0.64) than the estimates of Drugan and Willis (1996) and Drugan (2000), who used the Percus-Yevick-Wertheim model. Also, deviations in inclusion/void shape from spherical are shown to cause significant modifications to the nonlocal constitute equations, as evidence by nontrivial changes in predicted minimum RVE sizes.

			Abstract="Small-scale yielding around a stationary crack along a ductile single crystal - rigid material interface is analyzed. Plane strain conditions are assumed to prevail and geometry changes are neglected. The analyses are carried out using both continuum slip and discrete dislocation plasticity theory for model fcc and bcc crystal geometries having either two or three slip systems. Numerical and analytical asymptotic solutions are presented for continuum slip plasticity theory. Solutions exhibiting both slip bands and kink bands are obtained. The addition of a third slip system to ductile single crystals having two slip systems is found to have a significant effect on the interface crack-tip fields. The results illustrate the role that each of the formulations considered can play in elucidating crack tip fields in single crystals."

			Abstract="A Hashin-Shtrikman-Willis variational principle is employed to derive two exact micromechanics-based nonlocal constitutive equations relating ensemble averages of stress and strain for two-phase, and also many types of multi-phase, random linear elastic composite materials. By exact is meant that the constitutive equations employ the complete spatially-varying ensemble-average strain field, not gradient approximations to it as were employed in the previous, related work of Drugan and Willis (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 44 (1996) 497) and Drugan (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 48 (2000) 1359) (and in other, more phenomenological works). Thus, the nonlocal constitutive equations obtained here are valid for arbitrary ensemble-average strain fields, not restricted to slowly-varying ones as is the case for gradient-approximate nonlocal constitutive equations. One approach presented shows how to solve the integral equations arising from the variational principle directly and exactly, for a special, physically reasonable choice of the homogeneous comparison material. The resulting nonlocal constitutive equation is applicable to composites of arbitrary anisotropy, and arbitrary phase contrast and volume fraction. One exact nonlocal constitutive equation derived using this approach is valid for two-phase composites having any statistically uniform distribution of phases, accounting for up through two-point statistics and arbitrary phase shape. It is also shown that the same approach can be used to derive exact nonlocal constitutive equations for a large class of composites comprised of more than two phases, still permitting arbitrary elastic anisotropy. The second approach presented employs three-dimensional Fourier transforms, resulting in a nonlocal constitutive equation valid for arbitrary choices of the comparison modulus for isotropic composites. This approach is based on use of the general representation of an isotropic fourth-rank tensor function of a vector variable, and its inverse. The exact nonlocal constitutive equations derived from these two approaches are applied to some example cases, directly rationalizing some recently-obtained numerical simulation results and assessing the accuracy of previous results based on gradient-approximate nonlocal constitutive equations.

			Abstract="Composite materials of extremely high stiffness can be produced by employing one phase of negative stiffness. Negative stiffness entails a reversal of the usual codirectional relationship between force and displacement in deformed objects. Negative stiffness structures and materials are possible, but unstable by themselves. We argue here that composites made with a small volume fraction of negative stiffness inclusions can be stable and can have overall stiffness far higher than that of either constituent. This high composite stiffness is demonstrated via several exact solutions within linearized and also fully nonlinear elasticity, and via the overall modulus tensor estimate of a variational principle valid in this case. We provide an initial discussion of stability, and adduce experimental results which show extreme composite behavior in selected viscoelastic systems under sub-resonant sinusoidal load. Viscoelasticity is known to expand the space of stability in some cases. We have not yet proved that purely elastic composite materials of the types proposed and analyzed in this paper will be stable under static load. The concept of negative stiffness inclusions is buttressed by recent experimental studies illustrating related phenomena within the elasticity and viscoelasticity contexts.

			Abstract="Asymptotic solutions for the near-tip stress fields (and important features of the deformation fields) are derived for stationary plane strain tensile cracks in elastic-ideally plastic single crystals. The cases treated are (010) cracks pointing in the [101] direction, and (101) cracks in the [010] direction, for both FCC and BCC crystals that yield according to the critical resolved shear stress criterion. The objective is to derive solutions that concur with recent experimental studies and numerical discrete dislocation simulations of stationary crack tip fields in ductile single crystals. The solutions are derived within an extension of the framework laid down in the pioneering analysis of Rice (Mech. Mater. 6 (1987) 317). Rice&#x27;s solutions for the near-tip fields for cracks of the types considered here are at yield at all angles about the crack tip, and necessarily involve rays of stress and displacement discontinuity, with the latter being of both slip and kink type. His solutions capture several important features of the experiments and discrete dislocation simulations; however, there are significant differences, a key one being that the experiments, and in most cases the discrete dislocation simulations. do not appear to exhibit kink-type shear concentrations for the symmetric crack orientations considered. Thus we seek here asymptotic near-tip solutions that are free of kink-type displacement discontinuities. This necessitates the introduction of sub-yield near-tip sectors to permit derivation of solutions that produce the high stress triaxiality expected ahead of a crack tip under well-contained yielding conditions. The resulting solutions show several interesting differences with Rice&#x27;s solutions. A major one is that for cracks having the same orientations in FCC and BCC crystals, the near-tip stress fields in Rice&#x27;s solutions have identical sector assemblies and thus very similar character, whereas the present solutions for the FCC and BCC cases differ substantially. Another difference is that for the two crack orientations noted above in an FCC crystal (or in a BCC crystal), Rice&#x27;s near-tip stress field solutions are identical, whereas the present solutions differ substantially from one orientation to another. The experimental and discrete dislocation simulations confirm these features of the new solutions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

			Abstract="Two analytical mechanics-based models of dynamic fragmentation in brittle materials are proposed and solved to predict fragment size and time to fragmentation onset in terms of fundamental material properties and the applied strain rate. Previous widely adopted analytical models of dynamic fragmentation are based on relatively simple energy balance arguments, and assume that the fragmentation event occurs instantaneously. The present models account for the actual time-varying dynamic deformation that occurs prior to fragmentation onset. One of the models treats the fragmenting material as initially flaw-free, and determines the minimum fragment size predicted by a dynamic instability analysis. The second model accounts for initial flaw spacing (which may correlate physically with, for example, grain size), and a dynamic instability analysis is employed to determine which flaws become critical. The fragment size predictions of the present models and two previous energy-based models are found to agree at extremely high strain rates (approximate to 5 x 10(7)/s for dense alumina), but the present, more realistic analysis indicates that the regime of validity of the energy-based models is rather restricted. The predictions of the present models are also shown to agree with those of a recent numerical finite element simulation of dynamic fragmentation which applies to a lower strain rate regime. Comparisons of the two new models show that if a material contains initial flaws whose spacing is smaller than the predicted fragment size of an equivalent &#x22;unflawed&#x22; material, the fragment size of the preflawed material will be smaller in general, but usually not as small as the:initial flaw spacing. The analysis also permits determination of the evolution of the strain rate distribution in a prospective fragment before and after fragmentation initiation; results are presented for some example cases. Finally, closed-form analytical results are derived for minimum fragment size and time to fragmentation for strain rates in the quasi-static regime; these show the fragment size to be independent of strain rate in this regime, and the time to fragmentation initiation to be inversely proportional to the strain rate.

			Abstract="A generalization of the Hashin-Shtrikman variational formulation to random composites, due to J.R. Willis, is employed to derive micromechanics-based variational estimates for a higher-order nonlocal constitutive equation relating the ensemble averages of stress and strain, for a class of random linear elastic composite materials. We analyze two-phase composites with any isotropic and statistically uniform distribution of phases (which themselves may have arbitrary shape and anisotropy), within a formulation accounting for one- and two-point probabilities, and derive an explicit nonlocal constitutive equation that includes terms up through the fourth gradient of average strain. The analysis is carried out first for an arbitrary comparison medium. Then, a new approach is outlined and applied which employs the nonlocal correction to determine the optimal choice of comparison medium, and hence the optimal effective modulus tensor (as well as the optimal tensor coefficients of the nonlocal terms) for the amount of statistical information employed. The new higher order analysis provides a highly accurate nonlocal constitutive equation, valid down to quite small volume size scales and to rather strong variations of average strain with position. Among several applications illustrated, it permits accurate analytical assessment of the remarkably small predictions derived by Drugan and Willis (1996. Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 44, 497-524) of the minimum representative volume element (RVE) size needed for accuracy of the standard constant-effective-modulus macroscopic constitutive equation for elastic matrix-inclusion composites that have spherical inclusions/voids. It also affords an analytical assessment of the improved (i.e.. reduced) minimum RVE size scale. compared to a standard constant-effective-modulus constitutive equation, to which the leading-order nonlocal constitutive equation derived by Drugan and Willis applies. This improvement is shown to be dramatic in some example cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. AII rights reserved."

			Abstract="Previous work has shown that there are significant discrepancies between leading-order asymptotic analytical solutions for the elastic-plastic fields near growing crack tips and detailed numerical finite element solutions of the same problems. The evidence is dearest in the simplest physically realistic case: quasistatic anti-plane shear crack growth in homogeneous, isotropic elastic-ideally plastic material. There, the sore extant asymptotic analytical solution involves a plastic loading sector of radial stress characteristics extending about 20 degrees from ahead of the crack, followed by elastic unloading, whereas detailed numerical finite element solutions show the presence of an additional sector of plastic loading, extending from about 20 to about 50 degrees, that is comprised of non-radial characteristics. To explore how the asymptotic analysis can completely miss this important solution feature, we derive an exact representation for the stress and deformation fields in such a propagating region of non-radial characteristics, as well as in the other allowable solution regions. These exact solutions contain arbitrary functions, which are determined by applying asymptotic analysis to the solutions and assembling a complete near-tip solution, valid through second order, that is in agreement with the numerical finite element results. In so doing, we prove that the angular extent of the sector of non-radial characteristics, while substantial until extremely close to the crack tip, vanishes in the limit as the tip is approached, and that the solution in this sector is not of variable-separable form. Beyond resolving the analytical-numerical discrepancies in this specific anti-plane sheer problem, the analysis serves to caution, by explicit example, that purely leading-order asymptotic solutions to nonlinear crack growth problems cannot in general capture all essential physical features of the near-tip fields, and that the often-invoked assumption of variable-separable solutions is not always valid.

			Abstract="By comparing the First Law of thermodynamics in its shock wave form to its smooth wave form, and applying standard continuum mechanical conservation laws and geometrical compatibility, we prove for, arbitrary media that a shock wave which propagates without rotating under steady-state conditions is thermodynamically identical to a suitably-chosen steadily propagating smooth wave (and that this is not so in general for nonsteady shocks). This legitimizes the derivation of restrictions on steady-state shock waves by the analysis of suitably-chosen steady smooth waves in purely mechanical material models. Doing so for a broad class of rate-independent elastic-plastic materials rigorously corroborates several recently-published shuck restrictions whose derivations involved some (now validated) heuristic arguments, and substantially generalizes the material class for which these restrictions apply. Thus, e.g. within small-displacement-gradient theory, stress jumps are ruled out across steadily propagating shock waves in quasi static deformations of any nonsoftening material satisfying plastic normality and positive-definiteness of the elastic modulus tensor (removing the previous limitation of this result to materials that satisfy the global maximum plastic work inequality and whose current yield locus always incorporates all prior yield loci). We also confirm that steady-state shock waves in dynamic anti-plane strain or plane strain deformations cannot exist except at elastic wave speeds for nonhardening materials in the same broad constitutive class unless the yield surface contains a linear segment. Application of these results to steady-state dynamic subsonic plane strain crack growth in elastic-ideally plastic Prandtl-Reuss-Mises material proves that this problem&#x27;s solution must be shock-free. This implies that certain solutions containing strong discontinuity surfaces, obtained in a recently-published numerical finite element study of this dynamic I:rack growth problem, are not physically realizable. The conclusion is that either a more robust numerical procedure is necessary which incorporates the thermodynamics-mandated shock restrictions derived here, or that steady-state subsonic dynamic plane-strain elastic-plastic crack growth is not possible in this material model (and potentially not in nature for materials exhibiting plastic normality, purely nonlinear yield surfaces and no hardening).

			Abstract="Asymptotic stress and deformation fields near a quasi-statically growing plane strain tensile crack tip in porous elastic-ideally plastic material, characterized by the Gurson-Tvergaard yield condition and associated dow rule, are derived for small uniform porosity levels throughout the range 0 to 4.54 percent. The solution configuration resembles that for crack growth in fully dense, elastically compressible, elastic-ideally plastic Huber-Mises material for this porosity range, except that the angular extents and border locations of near-tip solution sectors vary with porosity level, as do the stress and deformation fields within sectors. Increasing porosity is found to result in a dramatic reduction in maximum hydrostatic stress level, greater than that for a stationary crack; it also causes a significant angular redistribution of stresses, particularly for a range of angles ahead of the crack and adjacent to the crack flank. The near-tip deformation fields derived are employed to generalize a previously-developed, successful ductile crack growth criterion. Our model predicts that for materials having the same initial slopes of their crack growth resistance curves, but different levels of uniform porosity, higher porosity results in a substantially greater propensity for stable crack growth."

			Abstract="Thermodynamical requirements on elastic-plastic shock waves are investigated to explore the range of validity of, and provide rigorous substantiation for, the previous shock analyses of Drugan and coworkers. These studies assumed (implicitly) that during shock passage, a material particle&#x27;s stress and deformation history is well-approximated by its history during passage of a smooth wave, and that the material response is purely mechanical, We show precisely the conditions under which these analyses are valid. Courant and Friedrichs&#x27; [(1948) Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves (Third Printing: 1985). Springer, Berlin] analysis of the order of entropy effects for weak one-dimensional shocks in mechanically conservative fluids is extended to shocks in general three-dimensional large deformations in a material of arbitrary constitution. Specifically, we prove that the change in thermodynamic state across a suitably-chosen smooth wave coincides with that across a general shock up until third order in material time rates of fundamental field variables, at which point contributions from the shock itself first appear. This result, which is valid even if entropy generation (due to mechanical dissipation) occurs at first or second order, corrects the common misconception that a shock may be approximated by a smooth wave only if the entropy generation is small. We further prove that for the special class of shocks that propagate under steady-slate conditions with non-rotating reference configuration images, a smooth wave can be constructed whose change in thermodynamic state coincides with that across the shock through all orders of field variable rates. That is, a smooth wave is a potentially exact model of a shock in this class. Having legitimized the representation of a shock by a smooth wave, a large deformation statement of the maximum plastic work inequality is integrated across the shock to give general thermomechanical existence conditions for steady shocks. These conditions reduce to those of Drugan and Rice [(1984) Restrictions on quasi-statically moving surfaces of strong discontinuity in elastic-plastic solids. In Mechanics of Material Behaviour (ed. G. J. Dvorak and R. T. Shield), pp. 59-73. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam] and Drugan and Shen [(1987) Restrictions on dynamically propagating surfaces of strong discontinuity in elastic-plastic solids.

			Abstract="This paper continues the investigation of Drugan and Miao (1992). There we studied analytically the influence of a uniform porosity distribution on the stress field near a plane strain tensile crack tip in ductile (elastic-ideally plastic) material, assuming that material very near the tip is at yield at all angles about the tip. Our solutions exhibited completely continuous stress fields for porosity f less-than-or-equal-to 0. 02979, but for higher porosities they involved radial surfaces of radial normal stress jumps. Here we investigate whether, for this higher range of porosity, relaxing our assumption of yield at all angles about the tip will facilitate solutions exhibiting fully continuous stress fields. The answer to this is shown to be yes, with a single near-tip sector assembly providing such solutions for this entire higher porosity range. On either side of the crack symmetry plane, this solution configuration consists of a leading plastic sector possessing radial stress characteristics (&#x27;&#x27;generalized centered fan&#x27;&#x27;), followed by a plastic sector of constant Cartesian components of stress, followed finally by a sector of purely elastic material adjacent to the crack flank, The angular extents of these sectors vary substantially with porosity level. In regions of purely elastic response, we have accounted for the influence of porosity on the overall, or effective, elastic moduli. Among the interesting features of these new solutions are a significantly enlarged generalized centered fan sector as compared to that of the fully plastic Part I solutions for the same f values, and for f values just slightly above the 0.02979 level, a narrow elastic sector exists in which stresses vary so rapidly with angle that they appear to be nearly discontinuous. This rapid variation spreads out as the elastic sector enlarges with increasing f, and, in contrast to the fully plastic solutions, the radial normal component of stress becomes negative near the crack flank."

			Abstract="Finite deformation finite element analyses of plane strain stationary and quasi-statically growing crack fields in fully incompressible elastic-ideally plastic material are reported for small-scale yielding conditions. A principal goal is to determine the differences between solutions of a rigorous finite deformation formulation and those of the usual small-displacement-gradient formulation, and thereby assess the validity of the (nearly all) extant studies of ductile crack growth that are based on a small-displacement-gradient formulation. The stationary crack case with a significantly blunted tip is studied first; excellent agreement in stress characteristics at all angles about the crack tip and up to a radius of about three times the crack tip opening displacement is shown between Rice and Johnson&#x27;s [1] approximate analytical solution and our numerical solution. Outside this radius, the numerical results agree very well with Drugan and Chen&#x27;s [2] small-displacement-gradient analytical characteristics solution in the region of principal plastic deformation. Thus we identify accurate analytical representations for the stress field throughout the plastic zone of a blunted stationary crack. For the growing crack case, the macroscopic difference in crack tip opening profiles between previous small-displacement-gradient solutions and the present results is shown to be negligible, as is the difference in the stress fields in plastic regions. The stress characteristics again agree very well with analytical results of [2]. The numerical results suggest - in agreement with a recent analytical finite deformation study by Reid and Drugan [3] -that it is the finite geometry changes rather than the additional spin terms in the objective constitutive equation that cause any differences between the small-displacement-gradient and the finite deformation solutions, and that such differences are nearly indistinguishable for growing cracks."

			Abstract="We have conducted numerical finite element studies of plane strain quasistatic crack growth in elastic-plastic material for a wide range of applied loading conditions and yielding extents, especially general yielding. To facilitate precise comparisons with previous analytical results, we have employed a fully incompressible, nonhardening material model. A reduced/selected integration procedure is successfully used to enforce material incompressibility. For crack growth under bending-dominant conditions, we employ an experimentally-measured applied load versus crack length history for a compact tension specimen that experiences crack growth from small-scale yielding through general yielding conditions. A constant crack tip opening angle crack growth criterion is employed to investigate crack growth under tension-dominant loadings in the same geometry. We have also conducted a small-scale yielding crack growth simulation employing a highly refined mesh, and several additional general yielding stationary crack solutions to further explore the effects of different far-field loading combinations. Detailed comparisons of the finite element results with Drugan and Chen&#x27;s [1] &#x27;m-family&#x27; of asymptotic analytical solutions are made in an effort to assess the latter&#x27;s accuracy and range of applicability, and to identify their asymptotically indeterminate parameters m and R as functions of crack growth history. Among several interesting results, we find that Drugan and Chen&#x27;s near-tip characterizing parameter has a nearly constant value of m almost-equal-to 1.23 for the entire crack growth process from small-scale yielding through general yielding conditions under bending-dominant loading when specimens have traction-free sides. However, we find m to vary significantly from that value as general yielding conditions are approached in tension-dominant loading situations, and whenever specimen sides are subjected to uniform applied loading. The numerical solutions confirm that Chen and Drugan&#x27;s [2] global approximate analytical solutions for general yielding crack growth are remarkably accurate to substantial distances from the crack tip under a wide variety of loading conditions. The fully incompressible material model employed also facilitates great physical insight into the global stress and deformation fields accompanying general yielding crack growth: numerous figures display the slip lines (which are characteristics for both the stress and velocity fields) throughout the plastically deforming regions."

			Abstract="AsYMPTOTIC, finite deformation solutions for the stress and velocity fields near the tip of a quasi-statically propagating Mode I plane strain crack in an incompressible, elastic-perfectly plastic material are derived. An objective form of the Prandtl-Reuss constitutive relation is employed. The solutions obtained are represented by a singular perturbation series with the singularity described by integer powers of the quantity (mu In r) where mu, the perturbation parameter. is of the order (yield stress/elastic modulus) and r is the non-dimensional distance from the crack tip. Previously developed small-displacement-gradient solutions are shown to result to leading order. However, the extension of these solutions to higher order is not straightforward; the introduction of strained coordinates and asymptotic modifications of the interfaces joining different near-tip angular sectors are required. The resulting solutions contain an asymptotically indeterminate parameter that is equivalent to the free parameter m in DRUGAN and CHEN&#x27;S (1989, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 37, 1) small-displacement-gradient solution family. Indeed, a principal conclusion is that the present solution approaches that of Drugan and Chen outside an extremely small radius (of the order of the microstructural scale of the material), differing significantly only for radii below which the quantity (mu In r) becomes significant compared to unity. Thus, at least for the constitutive class analysed, the finite deformation solutions confirm and quantify the remarkable accuracy and range of validity of the previous small-displacement-gradient growing crack solutions."

			Abstract="THE INFLUENCE of non-classical elastic-plastic constitutive features on dynamically moving discontinuities in stress, strain and material velocity is investigated. Non-classical behavior here includes non-normality of the plastic strain increment to the yield surface, plastic compressibility, pressure sensitivity of yield and dependence of the elastic moduli on plastic strain. DRUGAN and SHEN&#x27;S (1987) analysis of dynamically moving discontinuities with strain as well as stress jumps in classical materials is shown to be valid for a broad class of non-associative material models until deviation from normality exceeds a critical (non-infinitesimal) level. For these non-classical materials, an inequality that bounds the magnitude of the stress jump is derived, which is information not obtainable from a standard spectral analysis of a shock. For the special case of stress discontinuities with continuous strain or for quasi-static deformations, this inequality is shown to rule out jumps in specific projections of the stress tensor unless the non-normality is sufficiently large. These results invalidate a recent claim in the literature that an infinitesimal amount of non-normality permits moving surfaces of discontinuity in stress (with no strain jump) near the tip of a dynamically advancing crack tip. Using a very general plastic constitutive law that subsumes most non-classical (and classical) descriptions currently in use, a complete closed form solution is obtained for the plastic wave speeds and eigenvectors. A novel feature of the analysis is the clarity and completeness of the solutions. If the elastic part of the response is isotropic, one plastic wave speed equals the elastic shear wave speed, while the other two possible wave speeds depend in general on the stress and plastic strain within the shock transition layer. Concise necessary and sufficient conditions for real eigenvalues and for vanishing eigenvalues are derived. The real eigenvalues are classified by numerical sign and ordering relative to the elastic eigenvalues. The geometric multiplicity of plastic eigenvectors associated with elastic eigenvalues is shown to depend on the stress state within the shock transition layer. These solutions, several of which hold for arbitrary elastic anisotropy, are also applicable to acceleration waves and localization problems and to materials with dependence of the elastic moduli on plastic strain. Such elastic plastic coupling is shown to imply a non-self-adjoint fourth order tangent stiffness tensor even if the plastic constitutive law is associative."

			Abstract="We perform an analytical first study of the influence of a uniform porosity distribution, for the entire range of porosity level, on the stress field near a plane strain tensile crack tip in ductile material. Such uniform porosity distributions (approximately) arise in incompletely sintered or previously deformed (e.g., during processing) ductile metals and alloys. The elastic-plastic Gurson-Tvergaard constitutive formulation is employed. This model has a sound micromechanical basis, and has been shown to agree well with detailed numerical finite element solutions of, and with experiments on, voided materials. To facilitate closed-form analytical results to the extent possible, we treat nonhardening material with constant, uniform porosity. We show that the assumption of singular plastic strain in the limit as the crack tip is approached renders the governing equations statically determinate with two permissible types of near-tip angular sector: one with constant Cartesian components of stress (&#x22;constant stress&#x22;); and one with radial stress characteristics (&#x22;generalized centered fan&#x22;). The former admits an exact asymptotic closed-form stress field representation, and although we prove the latter does not, we derive a highly accurate closed-form approximate representation. We show that complete near-tip solutions can be constructed from these two sector types for the entire range of porosity. These solutions are comprised of three asymptotic sector configurations: (i) &#x22;generalized Prandtl field&#x22; for low porosities (0 less-than-or-equal-to f less-than-or-equal-to .02979), similar to the plane strain Prandtl field of fully dense materials, with a fully continuous stress field but sector extents that vary with porosity; (ii) &#x22;plane-stress-like field&#x22; for intermediate porosities (.02979 &#x3c; f &#x3c; .12029), resembling the plane stress solution for fully dense materials, with a ray of radial normal stress discontinuity but sector extents that vary with porosity; (iii) two constant stress sectors for the remaining high porosity range, with a ray of radial normal stress discontinuity and fixed sector extents. Among several interesting features, the solutions show that increasing porosity causes significant modification of the angular variation of stress components, particularly for a range of angles ahead of the crack tip, while also causing a drastic reduction in maximum hydrostatic stress level."

			Abstract="As an analytical first study of the mechanics of ductile-brittle interfacial crack growth, I derive the stress and deformation fields near the tip of a crack that is growing quasi-statically along an interface joining material phases idealized as being rigid on one side and homogeneous, isotropic, elastic-ideally plastic on the other. Both the cases of antiplane strain and plane strain are treated, since it is some combination of these that pertains near an interface crack under general three-dimensional conditions. In the antiplane strain case, a family of solutions for the growing crack fields is found covering all admissible crack line shear stress ratios except for the case when the shearing is parallel to the crack; the Mode III homogeneous material solution is shown to be a limiting member of this family. Two distinct solution families are shown to exist for the growing crack fields in the plane strain case. One of these contains the Mode I homogeneous material solution and is characterized by large crack line stress triaxialities (up to 39 percent higher than that in homogeneous material solutions), while the other family has a limiting member that closely resembles (but is not identical to) the Mode II homogeneous material solution and is characterized by small and even negative crack line stress triaxialities. These solutions, which appear to constitute all possible that involve traction-free crack faces, are shown to cover large portions, but not the entire admissible range, of crack line near-tip shear/normal stress ratios (&#x22;mixities&#x22;)."

			Abstract="THIS paper continues the effort begun in DRUGAN and CHEN [J. Mech. Phys. Solids 37, 1 (1989)] (Part I) to extend the theoretical foundations for understanding and quantitatively describing stable plane strain tensile crack growth to large-scale yielding and general yielding situations in ductile materials. We first confirm the veracity and physical appropriateness of Part I&#x27;s infinite series (in distance, r, from the crack tip) global representation of the growing crack stress field in extensions of &#x22;centered fan&#x22; plastic regions in isotropic, incompressible elastic-ideally plastic Prandtl-Reuss-Mises material. This is accomplished both by showing that this series almost always possesses a physically significant radius of convergence, and by calculating higher-order (in r) material velocity and plastic dissipation corrections. We then propound a method for employing this stress field representation to construct approximate global analytical solutions for crack growth in finite geometries at general yielding. The method is illustrated for the specific, practically important geometry of a crack approaching a straight, perpendicular surface; the applied loads considered are all combinations of bending and tension on the uncracked ligament, and all levels of uniform normal stress on the perpendicular surface, that together produce symmetric near-tip crack opening and general yielding of the ligament. An important product of these solutions is approximate analytical relations between Part I&#x27;s near-tip characterizing parameter m and the applied loading. These display interesting features: in situations where the applied bending dominates, m is shown (at least approximately) to be independent of the applied moment/tension ratio; whereas when the applied tension dominates, m does depend on this ratio. (The manner in which m varies with applied loading and geometry has a significant effect on crack growth criteria, as will be shown in Part III.) Our global solutions also provide specific analytical estimates of the radius of validity of the leading-order (in r) asymptotic solutions for differing far-field conditions; one particular, striking result is that this radius is exceedingly small for a purely tensile uncracked ligament at general yielding, but is enormously increased by application of a small bending moment. Comparisons between our approximate global analytical solutions and full-field numerical finite element solutions verify the analytical results and demonstrate their remarkable accuracy."

			Abstract="A two dimensional model developed for predicting the collapse behavior of photoresist structures due to drying of rinse liquids during wet chemical processing was discussed. The model was developed based on the beam bending mechanism which considered both elastic and plastic modes of deformation. The model was found to be efficient in predicting the critical beam height of collapse as a function of wetting behavior of the rinsing liquid in the beam, the elastic and plastic mechanical properties of the polymeric photoresist and the dimensions of the beam. It was stated that the model provided an efficient technique for measuring the mechanical properties of microstructured and nanostructured polymers."

			Abstract="Composite materials of extremely high stiffness can be produced by employing one phase of negative stiffness. Negative stiffness entails a reversal of the usual codirectional relationship between force and displacement in deformed objects. Negative stiffness structures and materials are possible, but unstable by themselves. We argue here that composites made with a small volume fraction of negative stiffness inclusions can be stable and can have overall stiffness far higher than that of either constituent. This high composite stiffness is demonstrated via several exact solutions within linearized and also fully nonlinear elasticity, and via the overall modulus tensor estimate of a variational principle valid in this case. We provide an initial discussion of stability, and adduce experimental results which show extreme composite behavior in selected viscoelastic systems under sub-resonant sinusoidal load. Viscoelasticity is known to expand the space of stability in some cases. We have not yet proved that purely elastic composite materials of the types proposed and analyzed in this paper will be stable under static load. The concept of negative stiffness inclusions is buttressed by recent experimental studies illustrating related phenomena within the elasticity and viscoelasticity contexts. &#x26;copy; 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

			Abstract="Two analytical mechanics-based models of dynamic fragmentation in brittle materials are proposed and solved to predict fragment size and time to fragmentation onset in terms of fundamental material properties and the applied strain rate. Previous widely adopted analytical models of dynamic fragmentation are based on relatively simple energy balance arguments, and assume that the fragmentation event occurs instantaneously. The present models account for the actual time-varying dynamic deformation that occurs prior to fragmentation onset. One of the models treats the fragmenting material as initially flaw-free, and determines the minimum fragment size predicted by a dynamic instability analysis. The second model accounts for initial flaw spacing (which may correlate physically with, for example, grain size), and a dynamic instability analysis is employed to determine which flaws become critical. The fragment size predictions of the present models and two previous energy-based models are found to agree at extremely high strain rates ( approximately equals 5 &#x26;times; 107/s for dense alumina), but the present, more realistic analysis indicates that the regime of validity of the energy-based models is rather restricted. The predictions of the present models are also shown to agree with those of a recent numerical finite element simulation of dynamic fragmentation which applies to a lower strain rate regime. Comparisons of the two new models show that if a material contains initial flaws whose spacing is smaller than the predicted fragment size of an equivalent &#x22;unflawed&#x22; material, the fragment size of the preflawed material will be smaller in general, but usually not as small as the initial flaw spacing. The analysis also permits determination of the evolution of the strain rate distribution in a prospective fragment before and after fragmentation initiation; results are presented for some example cases. Finally, closed-form analytical results are derived for minimum fragment size and time to fragmentation for strain rates in the quasi-static regime; these show the fragment size to be independent of strain rate in this regime, and the time to fragmentation initiation to be inversely proportional to the strain rate. &#x26;copy; 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd."

			Abstract="By comparing the First Law of thermodynamics in its shock wave form to its smooth wave form, and applying standard continuum mechanical conservation laws and geometrical compatibility, it was proven for arbitrary media that a shock wave propagating without rotating under steady-state conditions is thermodynamically identical to a suitably-chosen steadily propagating smooth wave. It was also confirmed that steady-state shock waves in dynamic anti-plane strain of plane strain deformations cannot exist except at elastic wave speeds for nonhardening materials in the same broad constitutive class unless the yield surface contains a linear segment. Application of these results to steady-state dynamic subsonic plane strain crack growth in elastic-ideally plastic Prandtl-Reuss-Mises material proves that this problem&#x27;s solution must be shock-free."

			Abstract="A fundamental understanding and characterization of ductile crack growth, and a rigorous basis for predicting final fracture (as opposed to crack growth initiation), are only possible from incremental elastic-plastic solutions of crack growth. Previous analytical investigations have provided leading-order (in distance, r, from the crack tip) asymptotic solutions for the near-tip stress and deformation fields. Such solutions have a limited range of validity. Here we review our recent work which derives plane strain tensile elastic-ideally plastic stress and deformation solutions valid through second order in r. We explain how the higher-order solution structure is derived, and we show with specific examples how these second-order solutions can be used to estimate the radius of validity, as a function of angle about the crack tip, of previous leading-order solutions. Comparisons with full-field numerical solutions demonstrate that the new second-order solutions substantially extend the leading-order solutions&#x27; range of validity. Such quantitative estimates of solutions&#x27; regions of validity seem essential for determining when ductile crack growth characterization based on homogeneous-continuum-mechanical asymptotic solutions is applicable to actual polycrystalline or composite materials with their finite-sized microstructures."

			Abstract="Asymptotic stress and deformation fields near a quasi-statically growing plane strain tensile crack tip in porous elastic-ideally plastic material, characterized by the Gurson-Tvergaard yield condition and associated flow rule, are derived for small uniform porosity levels throughout the range 0 to 4.54 percent. The solution configuration resembles that for crack growth in fully dense, elastically compressible, elastic-ideally plastic Huber-Mises material for this porosity range, except that the angular extents and border locations of near-tip solution sectors vary with porosity level, as do the stress and deformation fields within sectors. Increasing porosity is found to result in a dramatic reduction in maximum hydrostatic stress level, greater than that for a stationary crack; it also causes a significant angular redistribution of stresses, particularly for a range of angles ahead of the crack and adjacent to the crack flank. The near-tip deformation fields derived are employed to generalize a previously-developed, successful ductile crack growth criterion. Our model predicts that for materials having the same initial slopes of their crack growth resistance curves, but different levels of uniform porosity, higher porosity results in a substantially greater propensity for stable crack growth"

			Abstract="Thermodynamical requirements on elastic-plastic shock waves are investigated to explore the range of validity of, and provide rigorous substantiation for, the previous-shock analyses of Drugan and coworkers (1984-90). These studies assumed that during shock passage, a material particle&#x27;s stress and deformation history is well-approximated by its history during passage of a smooth wave, and that the material response is purely mechanical. We show precisely the conditions under which these analyses are valid. Courant and Friedrichs&#x27; (1948) analysis of the order of entropy effects for weak one-dimensional shocks in mechanically conservative fluids is extended to shocks in general three-dimensional large deformations in a material of arbitrary constitution. Specifically, we prove that the change in thermodynamic state across a suitably-chosen smooth wave coincides with that across a general shock up until third order in material time rates of fundamental held variables, at which point contributions from the shock itself first appear. This result, which is valid even if entropy generation (due to mechanical dissipation) occurs at first or second order, corrects the common misconception that a shock may be approximated by a smooth wave only if the entropy generation is small. We further prove that for the special class of shocks that propagate under steady-state conditions with non-rotating reference configuration images, a smooth wave can be constructed whose change in thermodynamic state coincides with that across the shock through all orders of field variable rates"

			Abstract="We have conducted numerical finite element studies of plane strain quasistatic crack growth in elastic-plastic material for a wide range of applied loading conditions and yielding extents, especially general yielding. To facilitate precise comparisons with previous analytical results, we have employed a fully incompressible, nonhardening material model. A reduced/selected integration procedure is successfully used to enforce material incompressibility. For crack growth under bending-dominant conditions, we employ an experimentally-measured applied load versus crack length history for a compact tension specimen that experiences crack growth from small-scale yielding through general yielding conditions. A constant crack tip opening angle crack growth criterion is employed to investigate crack growth under tension-dominant loadings in the same geometry. We have also conducted a small-scale yielding crack growth simulation employing a highly refined mesh, and several additional general yielding stationary crack solutions to further explore the effects of different far-field loading combinations. Detailed comparisons of the finite element results with Drugan and Chen&#x27;s [1] `m-family&#x27; of asymptotic analytical solutions are made in an effort to assess the latter&#x27;s accuracy and range of applicability, and to identify their asymptotically indeterminate parameters m and R as functions of crack growth history. Among several interesting results, we find that Drugan and Chen&#x27;s near-tip characterizing parameter has a nearly constant value of m approximately equals 1.23 for the entire crack growth process from small-scale yielding through general yielding conditions under bending-dominant loading when specimens have traction-free sides. However, we find m to vary significantly from that value as general yielding conditions are approached in tension-dominant loading situations, and whenever specimen sides are subjected to uniform applied loading. The numerical solutions confirm that Chen and Drugan&#x27;s [2] global approximate analytical solutions for general yielding crack growth are remarkably accurate to substantial distances from the crack tip under a wide variety of loading conditions. The fully incompressible material model employed also facilitates great physical insight into the global stress and deformation fields accompanying general yielding crack growth: numerous figures display the slip lines (which are characteristics for both the stress and velocity fields) throughout the plastically deforming regions."

			Abstract="Finite deformation finite element analyses of plane strain stationary and quasi-statically growing crack fields in fully incompressible elastic-ideally plastic material are reported for small-scale yielding conditions. A principal goal is to determine the differences between solutions of a rigorous finite deformation formulation and those of the usual small-displacement-gradient formulation, and thereby assess the validity of the (nearly all) extant studies of ductile crack growth that are based on a small-displacement-gradient formulation. The stationary crack case with a significantly blunted tip is studied first; excellent agreement in stress characteristics at all angles about the crack tip and up to a radius of about three times the crack tip opening displacement is shown between Rice and Johnson&#x27;s approximate analytical solution and our numerical solution. Outside this radius, the numerical results agree very well with Drugan and Chen&#x27;s small-displacement-gradient analytical characteristics solution in the region of principal plastic deformation. Thus we identify accurate analytical representations for the stress field throughout the plastic zone of a blunted stationary crack. For the growing crack case, the macroscopic difference in crack tip opening profiles between previous small-displacement-gradient solutions and the present results is shown to be negligible, as is the difference in the stress fields in plastic regions. The stress characteristics again agree very well with analytical results of [2]. The numerical results suggest - in agreement with a recent analytical finite deformation study by Reid and Drugan - that it is the finite geometry changes rather than the additional spin terms in the objective constitutive equation that cause any differences between the small-displacement-gradient and the finite deformation solutions, and that such differences are nearly indistinguishable for growing cracks."

			Abstract="This paper continues the investigation of Drugan and Miao (1992). There we studied analytically the influence of a uniform porosity distribution on the stress field near a plane strain tensile crack tip in ductile (elastic-ideally plastic) material, assuming that material very near the tip is at yield at all angles about the tip. Our solutions exhibited completely continuous stress fields for porosity f&#x3c;=0.02979, but for higher porosities they involved radial surfaces of radial normal stress jumps. Here we investigate whether, for this higher range of porosity, relaxing our assumption of yield at all angles about the tip will facilitate solutions exhibiting fully continuous stress fields. The answer to this is shown to be yes, with a single near-tip sector assembly providing such solutions for this entire higher porosity range. On either side of the crack symmetry plane, this solution configuration consists of a leading plastic sector possessing radial stress characteristics (`generalized centered fan&#x27;), followed by a plastic sector of constant Cartesian components of stress, followed finally by a sector of purely elastic material adjacent to the crack flank. The angular extents of these sectors vary substantially with porosity level. In regions of purely elastic response, we have accounted for the influence of porosity on the overall, or effective, elastic moduli. Among the interesting features of these new solutions are a significantly enlarged generalized centered fan sector as compared to that of the fully plastic Part I solutions for the same f values, and for f values just slightly above the 0.02979 level, a narrow elastic sector exists in which stresses vary so rapidly with angle that they appear to be nearly discontinuous. This rapid variation spreads out as the elastic sector enlarges with increasing f, and, in contrast to the fully plastic solutions, the radial normal component of stress becomes negative near the crack flank."

			Abstract="We perform an analytical first study of the influence of a uniform porosity distribution, for the entire range of porosity level, on the stress field near a plane strain tensile crack tip in ductile material. Such uniform porosity distributions (approximately) arise in incompletely sintered or previously deformed (e.g., during processing) ductile metals and alloys. The elastic-plastic Gurson-Tvergaard constitutive formulation is employed. This model has a sound micromechanical basis, and has been shown to agree well with detailed numerical finite element solutions of, and with experiments on, voided materials. To facilitate closed-form analytical results to the extent possible, we treat nonhardening material with constant, uniform porosity. We show that the assumption of singular plastic strain in the limit as the crack tip is approached renders the governing equations statically determinate with two permissible types of near-tip angular sector: one with constant Cartesian components of stress (&#x27;constant stress&#x27;); and one with radial stress characteristics (&#x27;generalized centered fan&#x27;). The former admits an exact asymptotic closed-form stress field representation, and although we prove the latter does not, we derive a highly accurate closed-form approximate representation. We show that complete near-tip solutions can be constructed from these two sector types for the entire range of porosity. These solutions are comprised of three asymptotic sector configurations: (i) &#x27;generalized Prandtl field&#x27; for low porosities (0 &#x3c;= f &#x3c;= .02979), similar to the plane strain Prandtl field of fully dense materials, with a fully continuous stress field but sector extents that vary with porosity; (ii) &#x27;plane-stress-like field&#x27; for intermediate porosities (.02979 &#x3c; f &#x3c; .12029), resembling the plane stress solution for fully dense materials, with a ray of radial normal stress discontinuity but sector extents that vary with porosity; (iii) two constants stress sectors for the remaining high porosity range, with a ray of radial normal stress discontinuity and fixed sector extents. Among several interesting features, the solutions show that increasing porosity causes significant modification of the angular variation of stress components, particularly for a range of angles ahead of the crack tip, while also causing a drastic reduction in maximum hydrostatic stress level."

			Abstract="For pt.I see ibid., vol.37, p.1 (1989). Confirms the veracity and physical appropriateness of the infinite series (in distance, r, from the crack tip) global representation of the growing crack stress field in extensions of `centered fan&#x27; plastic regions in isotropic, incompressible elastic-ideally plastic Prandtl-Reuss-Mises material. This is accomplished both by showing that this series almost always possesses a physically significant radius of convergence, and by calculating higher-order (in r) material velocity and plastic dissipation corrections. The authors then propound a method for employing this stress field representation to construct approximate global analytical solutions for crack growth in finite geometries at general yielding. The method is illustrated for the specific, practically important geometry of a crack approaching a straight, perpendicular surface; the applied loads considered are all combinations of bending and tension on the uncracked ligament, and all levels of uniform normal stress on the perpendicular surface, that together produce symmetric near-tip crack opening and general yielding of the ligament. An important product of these solutions is approximate analytical relations between the near-tip characterizing parameter m and the applied loading. These display interesting features: in situations where the applied bending dominates, m is shown (at least approximately) to be independent of the applied moment/tension ratio; whereas when the applied tension dominates, m does depend on this ratio"

			Abstract="As an analytical first study of the mechanics of ductile-brittle interfacial crack growth, I derive the stress and deformation fields near the tip of a crack that is growing quasi-statically along an interface joining material phases idealized as being rigid on one side and homogeneous, isotropic, elastic-ideally plastic on the other. Both the cases of antiplane strain and plane strain are treated, since it is some combination of these that pertains near an interface crack under general three-dimensional conditions. In the antiplane strain case, a family of solutions for the growing crack fields is found covering all admissible crack line shear stress ratios except for the case when the shearing is parallel to the crack; the Mode III homogeneous material solution is shown to be a limiting member of this family. Two distinct solution families are shown to exist for the growing crack fields in the plane strain case."

			Abstract="Reports the results of a finite deformation study of the conditions under which propagating surfaces of strong discontinuity (across which components of stress, strain or material velocity jump) can exist in a general class of purely mechanical elastic-plastic solids. By enforcing the standard weak continuum-mechanical requirements of momentum conservation and geometrical compatibility, together with skeletal constitutive assumptions that are in broad agreement with experimental results and that subsume many specific material models, the authors derive explicit jump conditions that must be satisfied by such moving surfaces (and which in many cases rule out their existence). The results confirm many of the restrictions derived previously via a small-displacement-gradient formulation, showing how those must be interpreted in a finite deformation situation. The cases of quasi-static and dynamic deformations are considered separately, and it is shown how the results are related. Finally, they derive a thermodynamically motivated jump dissipation inequality that is sensibly applied to an extremely broad class of elastic-plastic materials; the quasi-static version of this is identical in form to a dissipation inequality derived in a different manner by Knowles (1979) for propagating equilibrium shocks in purely hyperelastic materials"

			Abstract="For dynamic deformations of compressible elastic-ideally plastic materials in the practically important cases of plane stress and plane strain, we investigate the possible existence of propagating surfaces of strong discontinuity (across which components of stress, strain, or material velocity jump) within a small-displacement-gradient formulation. For each case, an explicit proof of the impossibility of such a propagating surface (except at an elastic wave speed) is achieved for isotropic materials satisfying a Huber-Mises yield condition and associated flow rule, and we show that our method of proof can be generalized to a large class of anisotropic materials. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that moving surfaces of strong discontinuity cannot be ruled out for all stable (i.e., satisfying the maximum plastic work inequality) materials, as in the case of a material whose yield surface contains a linear portion. A clear knowledge of the conditions under which dynamically propagating strong discontinuity surfaces can and cannot exist is crucial to the attainment of correct and complete solutions to such practical elastic-plastic problems as dynamic crack propagation, impact and rapidly moving load problems, high-speed forming, cutting, and other manufacturing processes."

			Abstract="In an effort to extend the theoretical foundations for understanding and quantitatively describing stable plane strain tensile crack growth in ductile materials to large-scale and general yielding situations, we derive a new family of solutions for the near-tip stress and deformation fields of such growing cracks, within the most analytically tractable model of isotropic, incompressible, elastic-ideally plastic Prandtl-Reuss-Mises material. We provide evidence that the present solution family, which involves a parameter that is unspecified by the near-tip analysis, may be able to describe growing crack fields for the entire range of yielding extent from small-scale through general yielding conditions in potentially arbitrary Mode I plane strain geometries. Except for the &#x27;modified Prandtl field&#x27; limiting case, all members of the new solution family exhibit: (i) singular straining in the &#x27;constant stress&#x27; plastic sector ahead of the growing crack tip as well as in the &#x27;centered fan&#x27; plastic sectors that lie above and below the growing tip; and (ii) completely continuous near-tip stress and velocity fields."

			Abstract="For dynamic three-dimensional deformations of elastic-plastic materials, we elicit conditions necessary for the existence of propagating surfaces of strong discontinuity (across which components of stress, strain or material velocity jump). This is accomplished within a small-displacement-gradient formulation of standard weak continuum-mechanical assumptions of momentum conservation and geometrical compatibility, and skeletal constitutive assumptions which permit very general elastic and plastic anisotropy including yield surface vertices and anisotropic hardening. In addition to deriving very explicit restrictions on propagating strong discontinuities in general deformations, we prove that for anti-plane strain and incompressible plane strain deformations, such strong discontinuities can exist only at elastic wave speeds in generally anisotropic elastic-ideally plastic materials unless a material&#x27;s yield locus in stress space contains a linear segment. The results derived seem essential for correct and complete construction of solutions to dynamic elastic-plastic boundary-value problems."

			Abstract="The paper is an extension of work by Drugan et al. (1982) who derive the stress and deformation fields at the tip of a plane strain tensile crack that grows quasi-statically, under general nonsteady conditions, in an elastic-ideally plastic solid. A higher-order analysis of the near-tip fields for this growing crack problem is performed. Principal objectives are to determine the radial variation of the near-tip stress field and elucidate the structure of the deformation fields in the 90-deg sector ahead of the growing crack. The analysis presented differs from typical perturbation analyses in that the author is able to derive the higher-order structure of the continuum fields rather than having to assume expansions for them."

			Abstract="In a recent study, Drugan and Rice (1984) investigated what restrictions are placed on the possible existence of quasi-statically moving surfaces of strong discontinuity (across which components of stress, strain or velocity jump) by standard weak continuum mechanical assumptions coupled with skeletal constitutive assumptions believed to describe realistically a large class of elastic-plastic materials. A more direct and general version of Drugan and Rice&#x27;s main proof which lays bare its key features is developed. This facilitates a demonstration that the severe restrictions deduced by Drugan and Rice do not hinge on their assumption of elastic linearity, but rather that the elastic component of material response can be arbitrary hyperelastic, with the key restrictions being that the elastic strain energy function is strictly convex and unaffected by plastic deformation."

			Abstract="An exact asymptotic analysis is presented of the stress and deformation fields near the tip of a quasistatically advancing plane strain tensile crack in an elastic-ideally plastic solid. In contrast to previous approximate analyses, no assumptions which reduce the yield condition, a priori, to the form of constant inplane principal shear stress near the crack tip are made, and the analysis is valid for general Poisson ratio v. Specific results are given for v equals 0. 3 and 0. 5, the latter duplicating solutions in previous work by L. I. Slepyan, Y. -C. Gao and the present authors. The crack tip field is shown to divide into five angular sectors of four different types; in the order in which these sweep across a point in the vicinity of the advancing crack, they are: two plastic sectors which can be described asymptotically (i. e. , as r yields 0, where r is distance from the crack tip) in slip-line terminology as &#x27;constant stress&#x27; and &#x27;centered fan&#x27; sectors, respectively; a plastic sector of non-constant stress which cannot be described asymptotically in terms of slip lines; an elastic unloading sector; and a trailing plastic sector of the same type as that directly preceding the elastic sector."
