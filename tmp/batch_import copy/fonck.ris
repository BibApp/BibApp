N2  - Formation of tokamak-like plasmas via electrostatic helicity injection in the ultra-low aspect ratio Pegasus Toroidal Experiment is reported. Two low-impurity, high-current (1 kA) washer gun current sources have been installed in the lower divertor region. These initially drive current along helical field lines produced by the applied toroidal and vertical fields. At sufficiently low values of externally applied vertical field, the poloidal field generated by the plasma is large enough to cause a poloidal flux reversal. In these cases the plasma relaxes into a tokamak-like configuration. Discharges with I<sub>&phi;</sub> &ap; 30 kA are produced with less than 2 kA of injected current. These discharges exhibit features indicative of tokamak plasmas, including reversal of poloidal flux at the center column, strong vacuum field deformation, increased current decay times, increased core heating, and characteristic MHD modes common to other helicity-injection-driven toroidal devices.

N2  - Initial experiments in the PEGASUS ST exhibited an operational limit of I<sub>p</sub> ~ I<sub>tf</sub> at A ~ 1.15. With new power supplies, discharge control has greatly increased. Equilibria and stability modeling of the high I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>tf</sub> regime has produced stable equilibria with I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>tf</sub> up to 2 while values of I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>tf</sub> approaching 3 show a potential upper bound on stability. A new operating regime has been accessed in recent experiments with the addition of electrostatic plasma sources. Using the sources as a pre-ionization technique, I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>tf</sub> values of 1.5 have been accessed at very low toroidal fields. Using the sources as a means for non-inductive startup, values of I<sub>p</sub>/I<sub>tf</sub> up to 2.3 are attained. The MHD activity in these discharges is characteristically different than ohmic discharges, suggesting the new current sources are modifying the current profile to allow stable discharge evolution at minimal toroidal field.

N2  - An upgraded beam emission spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic has been developed and deployed at the DIII-D tokamak to achieve a dramatic increase in sensitivity to small-scale density fluctuations. This upgraded BES diagnostic system incorporates high-throughput silica optical fiber bundles (1.62 mm<sup>2</sup>-ster per channel), ultra fast spectrometer collection optics, custom-designed high-transmission interference filters, and large-area photodiodes. The fiber bundle images are optimized to match measured radial and poloidal asymmetries of turbulent eddies. These enhancements result in an approximately one order of magnitude increase in measured beam emission signal. As a consequence of the relative contributions of photon and electronic noise, the net increase in sensitivity to plasma density fluctuation power ranges from ten to 30, allowing for the observation of small-amplitude (&ntilde;/n&ges;0.1%) density fluctuations associated with turbulence and energetic particle modes in the core of high-performance discharges. An array of 16 BES channels has been arranged in a 4&times;4 grid to provide modest-field (3.2&times;5 cm), high-sensitivity imaging capability that extends over multiple turbulence correlation lengths. This diagnostic capability allows for the first direct imaging of turbulence in the core region of low-confinement and high-confinement tokamak plasmas

N2  - The spatial transfer function for the beam emission spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic is critical to quantitatively interpret local density fluctuation measurements. A three-dimensional geometrical calculation of the spatial transfer function is presented for the upgraded BES diagnostic on DIII-D to determine its spatial resolution and wave-number sensitivity. The spatial transfer function calculation for the BES system on DIII-D incorporates the high speed (f/2) collection optics, an optical fiber bundle, neutral beam-sight line geometry, the neutral beam cross-section intensity profile, magnetic field pitch angle, as well as atomic physics of the finite atomic transition time of the collisionally excited beam atoms. The resulting imaged volumes for each BES channel typically have ~1-2 cm radial and poloidal resolutions. In addition, the viewing volume is nominally aligned along a magnetic field line to minimize spatial smearing of the field-aligned turbulent eddies. This calculation is crucial for performing the proper deconvolution of measured signals to determine correlation lengths and wave-number spectra of the measured density fluctuations, and is also required for applying synthetic diagnostics to nonlinear turbulence simulation codes (e.g., GYRO) to relate code output to measured signals

N2  - The Pegasus Toroidal Experiment was developed to explore the physics limits of plasma operation as the aspect ratio (A) approaches unity. Initial experiments on the device found that access to high normalized current and toroidal beta was limited by the presence of large-scale tearing modes. Major upgrades have been conducted of the facility to provide the control tools necessary to mitigate these resistive modes. The upgrades include new programmable power supplies, new poloidal field coils and increased, time-variable toroidal field. First ohmic operations with the upgraded system demonstrated position and current ramp-rate control, as well as improvement in ohmic flux consumption from 2.9 MA Wb<sup>-1</sup> to 4.2 MA Wb<sup>-1</sup>. The upgraded experiment will be used to address three areas of physics interest. First, the kink and ballooning stability boundaries at low A and high normalized current will be investigated. Second, clean, high-current plasma sources will be studied as a helicity injection tool. Experiments with two such sources have produced toroidal currents three times greater than predicted by geometric field line following. Finally, the use of electron Bernstein waves to heat and drive current locally will be studied at the 1 MW level; initial modelling indicates that these experiments are feasible at a frequency of 2.45 GHz

N2  - Characteristics and scaling properties of the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM), a coherent, radially-sheared high frequency (~15 kHz) zonal flow oscillation, are studied systematically using time-delay-estimation techniques applied to localized, multi-point density fluctuation measurements obtained by beam emission spectroscopy on DIII-D. The GAM amplitude is shown to increase strongly with increasing safety factor, q<sub>95</sub>, and to likewise become undetectably small for q<sub>95</sub> &lt; 4.2, qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions based on collisional damping as well as simulations. The radial structure of the GAM exhibits peak amplitude in the radial range 0.88 &lt; r/a &lt; 0.95 with a rapid amplitude reduction inside and outside this region. The measured frequency is close to the predicted frequency, though some deviation to higher frequency is observed at lower q. The GAM amplitude is also shown to increase with plasma elongation, &kappa;, while its frequency decreases

N2  - Characteristics and scaling properties of the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM), a coherent, radially-sheared high frequency ( [similar to] 15 kHz) zonal flow oscillation, are studied systematically using time-delay-estimation techniques applied to localized, multi-point density fluctuation measurements obtained by beam emission spectroscopy on DIII-D. The GAM amplitude is shown to increase strongly with increasing safety factor, q<sub>95</sub>, and to likewise become undetectably small for q<sub>95</sub> less than or equal 4.2, qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions based on collisional damping as well as simulations. The radial structure of the GAM exhibits peak amplitude in the radial range 0.88 less than or equal r/a less than or equal 0.95 with a rapid amplitude reduction inside and outside this region. The measured frequency is close to the predicted frequency, though some deviation to higher frequency is observed at lower q. The GAM amplitude is also shown to increase with plasma elongation, &kappa;, while its frequency decreases. &copy; 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - The divertor magnetic geometry has a significant effect on the poloidal velocity and resulting velocity shear of turbulent density fluctuations in the outer region of L-mode tokamak plasmas, as determined via two-dimensional measurements of density fluctuations with beam emission spectroscopy on DIII-D [J. L. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614 (2002)]. Plasmas with similar parameters, except that in one case the ion &nabla;B drift points towards the divertor X point (lower-single-null, LSN), and in the other case, the ion &nabla;B drift points away from the divertor X point (upper-single-null, USN), are compared. Inside r/a=0.9, the turbulence characteristics (density fluctuation amplitude, flow direction, correlation lengths) are similar in both cases, while near r/a=0.92, a dramatic reversal of the poloidal velocity of turbulent eddies relative to the core flow direction is observed in plasmas with the ion &nabla;B drift pointing towards the divertor X point. No such velocity reversal is observed in plasmas with the ion &nabla;B drift pointing away from the divertor X point. This poloidal velocity reversal results in a significantly larger local shear in the poloidal velocity of density fluctuations in plasmas with the ion &nabla;B drift pointing towards the divertor X point. Additionally, these plasmas locally exhibit significant dispersion with two distinct and counterpropagating turbulence modes. Likewise, the radial correlation length of the density fluctuations is reduced in these plasmas, consistent with biorthogonal decomposition measurements of dominant turbulence structures. The naturally occurring density fluctuation poloidal velocity shear in these LSN plasmas may facilitate the L-H transition that occurs at an input power of roughly one-half to one-third that of corresponding plasmas with the ion &nabla;B drift pointing away from the X point

N2  - Analysis techniques to measure the time-resolved flow field of turbulence are developed and applied to images of density fluctuations obtained with the beam emission spectroscopy diagnostic system on the DIII-D tokamak. Velocimetry applications include measurement of turbulent particle flux, zonal flows, and the Reynolds stress. The flow field of turbulent eddies exhibits quasisteady poloidal flows as well as high-frequency radial and poloidal motion associated with electrostatic potential fluctuations and strongly nonlinear multifield interactions. The orthogonal dynamic programming technique, developed for fluid-based particle and amorphous shape (smoke) flow analysis, is investigated to measure such turbulence flows. Sensitivity and accuracy are assessed and sample results discussed. &copy; 2004 American Institute of Physics.

N2  - Zonal flows, thought crucial to the saturation and self-regulation of turbulence and turbulent transport in magnetically confined plasmas, have been observed and characterized in the edge region of DIII-D plasmas. These flows exhibit temperature scaling characteristics and spatial features predicted for seen in nonlinear simulations of plasma turbulence.

Spatial and temporal analysis of the resulting flow-field demonstrates the existence of a coherent oscillation (approximately 15 kHz) in the poloidal flow of density fluctuations that has a long poloidal wavelength, possibly m = 0, narrow radial extent (k<sub>r</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub> &lt; 0.2), and a frequency that varies monotonically with local temperature. The approximate effective shearing rate, dv<sub>&thetas;</sub>/dr, of the flow is of the same order of magnitude as measured nonlinear decorrelation rate of the turbulence.

N2  - The Pegasus Toroidal Experiment [R. Fonck et al., Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 41, 1400 (1996)] is a spherical torus designed to study the limits of plasma behavior as the aspect ratio A approaches unity. Access to near-unity A is achieved through the use of a novel high-stress reinforced solenoid magnet. High toroidal beta &beta;<sub>t</sub> is obtained in ohmically-heated plasmas by operation at low field with densities up to the Greenwald limit. Values of &beta;<sub>t</sub> up to 20% and normalized beta up to 5 have been obtained. The ratio of plasma current to toroidal field rod current, known as the toroidal field utilization, reaches values as large as 1 but appears to approach a "soft" boundary at that level related to both ohmic flux limitations and the onset of resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity. The m/n=2/1 and 3/2 modes are most frequently observed, in agreement with the inferred safety factor profiles. Experiments are beginning to access the external kink stability boundary at edge safety factor q<sub>95</sub>=5, which is significantly higher than that observed in conventional tokamaks. Calculations using the DCON code [A. H. Glasser and M. S. Chance, Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 42, 1848 (1997)] confirm instability to the ideal kink

N2  - The application of time-delay-estimation techniques to two-dimensional measurements of density fluctuations, obtained with beam emission spectroscopy in DIII-D [J. L. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614 (2002)] plasmas, has provided temporally and spatially resolved measurements of the turbulence flow-field. Features that are characteristic of self-generated zonal flows are observed in the radial region 0.85&les;r/a&les;1.0. These features include a coherent oscillation (approximately 15 kHz) in the poloidal flow of density fluctuations that has a long poloidal wavelength, possibly m=0, narrow radial extent (k<sub>r</sub>&rho;<sub>I</sub>&lt;0.2), and whose frequency varies monotonically with the local temperature. The approximate effective shearing rate, dv<sub>&thetas;</sub>/dr, of the flow is of the same order of magnitude as the measured nonlinear decorrelation rate of the turbulence, and the density fluctuation amplitude is modulated at the frequency of the observed flow oscillation. Some phase coherence is observed between the higher wavenumber density fluctuations and low frequency poloidal flow fluctuations, suggesting a Reynolds stress contribution. These characteristics are consistent with predicted features of zonal flows, specifically identified as geodesic acoustic modes, observed in 3-D Braginskii simulations of core/edge turbulence

N2  - Two-dimensional measurements of density fluctuations are obtained in the radial and poloidal plane of the DIII-D tokamak with the Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic system. The goals are to visualize the spatial structure and time evolution of turbulent eddies, as well as to obtain the 2D statistical properties of turbulence. The measurements are obtained with an array of localized BES spatial channels configured to image a midplane region of the plasma. 32 channels have been deployed, each with a spatial resolution of about 1 cm in the radial and poloidal directions, thus providing measurements of turbulence in the wave number range 0&lt;k<sub>&perp;</sub>&les;3 cm<sup>-1</sup>. A 5 (radial)&times;6 (poloidal) channel grid provides time-resolved images near the outer midplane at the sampling frequency of 1 MHz, thus providing a modest spatial resolution, high throughput, high time resolution turbulence imaging system. The images and resulting movies have broad application to a wide variety of fundamental turbulence studies: imaging of the highly complex, nonlinear turbulent eddy interactions, measurement of the 2D correlation function, and S(k<sub>r</sub>,k<sub>&thetas;</sub>) wave number spectra, and direct measurement of the equilibrium and time-dependent turbulence flow field. The time-dependent, two-dimensional turbulence velocity flow-field is obtained with time-delay-estimation techniques

N2  - Time-resolved measurements of the turbulent density flow field in a tokamak plasma reveal low-frequency (~15 kHz), coherent oscillations in the poloidal flow, &nu;&macr;<sub>&thetas;</sub>. These flow oscillations have a long poloidal wavelength (m &lt; 3) and narrow radial extent (k<sub>r</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub> ~ 0.2). The estimated flow-shearing rate is of the same order of magnitude as the turbulence decorrelation rate and may thus regulate the turbulence amplitude. These features are consistent with theoretically predicted axisymmetric, self-regulating, sheared flows recognized as geodesic acoustic modes

N2  - Measurements of poloidal flow-field fluctuations were derived from time-delay-estimation analysis of local density turbulence. As such, density turbulence was measured in the DIII-D tokamak using beam emission spectroscopy (BES). Thus, BES was deployed on DIII-D to measure density fluctuations at 32 spatial locations on a 5 by 6 cm grid in the outer midplane of the poloidal cross section of the plasma. This paper demonstrates the first application of this analysis technique to density fluctuation data in tokamak plasmas.

N2  - Two-dimensional measurements of density fluctuations have been performed in DIII-D using the beam emission spectroscopy diagnostic. The 32 spatial channels are arranged to image a 5&times;6 cm<sup>2</sup> (radial&times;poloidal) region in the plasma cross section, at a nominal 1 cm spatial resolution and separation. The typical decorrelation time, poloidal and radial correlation lengths, as well as a time-averaged flow field plot are obtained from spatial and temporal correlation analyses. A biorthogonal decomposition algorithm is applied to expand the data set into a set of modes that are orthogonal in time and in space, thus providing a simultaneous analysis of the space and time dependencies of fluctuation data

N2  - Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction on the PEGASUS toroidal experiment is a crucial tool to determine macroscopic plasma parameters, such as geometry, l<sub>i</sub>, &beta;<sub>t</sub>, and q<sub>&psi;</sub>. These parameters are tightly coupled to the plasma shape due to the very high toroidicity in PEGASUS where <i>A</i>&ap;1.1-1.3. A systematic scan of model plasma parameters in a magnetic equilibrium code has been employed to determine an acceptable array of magnetic diagnostics for accurately characterizing the plasma equilibrium. The magnetic diagnostics used include a poloidal array of magnetic pickup coils and flux loops along with a Rogowski loop for the toroidal plasma current. A 270 GHz &mu; wave interferometer for line averaged density in conjunction with spectroscopic temperature estimates provide a central pressure constraint. Visible images of the plasma provide constraints on the plasma size and location. A one-dimensional SXR camera is being developed to provide a measurement of the magnetic axis location. A time evolving current filament model and wall flux loops are used to determine the induced currents flowing in the continuous, resistive vacuum vessel wall. The ability of the equilibrium reconstruction code to reproduce model equilibria using this diagnostic set provides a quantitative measure of the accuracy of these equilibrium reconstructions. A Monte Carlo analysis with Gaussian noise added to the model data tests the robustness of this technique. A comparison of the model equilibria with the reconstructions obtained using noisy data is shown

The sensitivity to plasma fluctuations at Ly<sub>&alpha;</sub> is estimated to be about 50 times higher than at D<sub>&alpha;</sub>. This dramatically increases the photon-noise-limited signal-to-noise ratio. Design criteria include a spectral resolution of &Delta;&lambda;&ap;0.5 nm at Ly<sub>&alpha;</sub>, to isolate the Doppler-shifted beam emission from the bright edge L<sub>&alpha;</sub> emission; high quantum efficiency detectors; high optical throughput; multichannel capability in the radial and poloidal directions; spatial resolution near 1 cm in the radial and poloidal directions to measure fluctuations in the wave number range 0.1&les;k<sub>r</sub>, k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&les;3 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

N2  - Motional Stark effect measurements of internal field structure in low-field magnetic confinement configurations are considered for both magnitude and direction of the local magnetic field. The amplitude and phase delay of an oscillating spectral linewidth driven by a rotating polarizer provides a means of determining the magnitude and direction of the total field simultaneously while avoiding difficulties of neutral beam energy drift. Photon-noise limit estimates for a diagnostic beam on the low-field PEGASUS toroidal experiment indicate sensitivities of roughly 20 G and 0.2&deg; for the magnitude and direction angle. These values are sufficient to provide significant constraints on magnetic equilibrium reconstructions

N2  - A wavelet-transform-based spectral analysis is examined for application to beam emission spectroscopy (BES) data to extract poloidal rotation velocity fluctuations from the density turbulence data. Frequency transfer functions for a wavelet cross-phase extraction method are calculated. Numerical noise is reduced by shifting the data to give an average zero time delay, and the applicable frequency range is extended by numerical oversampling of the measured density fluctuations. This approach offers potential for direct measurements of turbulent transport and detection of zonal flows in tokamak plasma turbulence

N2  - Reducing turbulence has been shown to improve confinement under a variety of plasma operational modes. Turbulence measurements during the formation of internal transport barriers in plasmas with negative central magnetic shear have shown that turbulence-driven fluctuations are dramatically reduced inside the barrier while energy transport is also reduced. This is consistent with the E&times;B shearing model of turbulence suppression during formation of an internal transport barrier. A complementary path to turbulence suppression is suggested by recent experiments in which impurities are puffed into a quiescent L-mode discharge. Turbulence is dramatically reduced in response to the impurity puff, and energy confinement increases simultaneously. This behavior is consistent with gyrokinetic simulations which indicate that dilution of the working ions by impurities can reduce the growth rates of ion temperature gradient driven turbulence

N2  - The perturbations in ion temperature, density and parallel velocity resulting from sawtooth disruptions in TFTR are measured with a novel diagnostic. The local ion thermal diffusivity, particle diffusivity and parallel momentum diffusivity are determined in a high power discharge at r/a=0.64 by fitting the observed pulses to a simple model of the radial diffusive propagation of heat, particles and momentum caused by the crash. The incremental ion thermal diffusivity, &chi;<sub>i</sub><sup>inc</sup>, is found to be similar in amplitude to the ion and electron thermal diffusivities obtained from a steady state 1-D power balance analysis, and the particle and parallel momentum diffusivities are found to be an order of magnitude smaller than &chi;<sub>i</sub><sup>inc</sup>

N2  - The deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction rate in a spherically convergent ion focus is observed to significantly exceed the rate predicted by a collisionless flow model. However, a careful consideration of ion-neutral collisions and the trapped neutral density in the cathode account for the extra reactivity without invoking anomalous ion trapping in the converged core region. This conclusion is supported by proton collimation measurements, which indicate that the bulk of the observed reactivity originates outside the core region. In addition, a classical flow model, where charge exchange collisional effects on the ion and fast neutral distributions are included, provides fusion rate estimates that are quantitatively consistent with the observed D-D fusion neutron production rat.

N2  - First of a king measurements of high-frequency ion temperature microturbulence in fusion-grade plasmas have been made in TFTR. The ion temperature fluctuations and carbon density fluctuations were found to have spectra similar to those of the ion density fluctuations across the plasma radius. The ratio of the relative fluctuation levels, (T(over-tilde)/T)/(n(over-tilde)/n), is 2&plusmn;0.5 from r/a = 0.59 to r/a = 0.99. The fact that this ratio is greater than unity is consistent with the general expectations of ion temperature gradient driven turbulence theory and suggests that ion drift modes dominate trapped electron modes in the turbulent spectrum. The temperature fluctuation spectra were found to exhibit a narrow transition region between distinctive edge and core turbulent modes, as has been seen with ion density fluctuations. The ratio of the relative fluctuation levels is greater than unity across this transition, which suggests that, despite the different modes present, the underlying instability is driven by the ion temperature gradient.

N2  - Unique measurements of the basic plasma-flow characteristics in a low pressure (&les;53 mPa H<sub>2</sub>) spherically convergent ion focus are obtained using high-voltage (&les;5 kV) emissive and double probes. The radial plasma potential distribution agrees with a collisionless, recirculating, space-charge-limited current model. Flow convergence increases with voltage and neutral pressure and decreases with cathode grid wire spacing and current. Core radii within 4-5 times the ideal geometric limit are measured, and the observed core sizes are consistent with predictions from a multipass orbit model which includes asymmetries in the accelerating potential well. A virtual anode is observed in the converged core region, and no evidence for multiple potential well structures in the core is found. Measurements of the core ion density (n<sub>ic</sub>~10<sup>15</sup> m<sup>-3</sup>) are consistent with simple flow convergence models

N2  - A new procedure for calculating the nonlinear energy transfer and linear growth/damping rate of fully developed turbulence is derived. It avoids the unphysically large damping rates typically obtained using the predecessor method of Ritz [Ch.P. Ritz, E.J. Powers, and R.D. Bengtson, Phys. Fluids B <b>1</b>, 153 (1989)]. It enforces stationarity of the turbulence to reduce the effects of noise and fluctuations not described by the basic governing equation, and includes the fourth-order moment to avoid the closure approximation. The new procedure has been implemented and tested on simulated, fully developed two-dimensional (2-D) turbulence data from a 2-D trapped-particle fluid code, and has been shown to give excellent reconstructions of the input growth rate and nonlinear coupling coefficients with good noise rejection. However, in the experimentally important case where only a one-dimensional (1-D) averaged representation of the underlying 2-D turbulence is available, this technique does not, in general, give acceptable results. A new 1-D algorithm has thus been developed for analysis of 1-D measurements of intrinsically 2-D turbulence. This new 1-D algorithm includes the nonresonant wave numbers in calculating the bispectra, and generally gives useful results when the width of the radial wave number spectrum is comparable to or less than that of the poloidal spectrum

N2  - The bulk fluid velocity is measured spectroscopically with 10 &mu;s time resolution in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed-field pinch (RFP) [Fusion Technol. 19, 131 (1991)], a diagnostic capability used to study the fast flow dynamics associated with locked modes and the RFP dynamo. The phase velocity of the tearing modes and the fluid velocity accelerate between sawtooth events, reaching a maximum speed of about 20 km/s in a few ms. Both slow down at the sawtooth crash in &ap;100 &mu;s. This deceleration time scale is as calculated for the tearing modes from the action of electromagnetic torque on the magnetic islands, but is much faster than expected from the viscous torque on the bulk fluid. In the RFP, correlated fluctuations in the tearing modes and fluid velocity probably also generate current via the &ldquo;RFP dynamo,&rdquo; &lang;u&tilde;&times;B&tilde;&rang;, where u is the bulk fluid velocity. Initial data indicate a possible increase in &lang;u&tilde;<sub>&phi;</sub>B&tilde;<sub>r</sub>&rang; during sawtooth events, coincident with toroidal flux generation

N2  - Summary form only given, as follows. We measure the bulk fluid velocity with 100 kHz resolution in the MST reversed-field pinch (RFP). This diagnostic capability provides the ability to study the fast flow dynamics associated with locked modes. A fast duo-spectrometer simultaneously measures the red and blue Doppler shifts of spectral line radiation emitted by impurity ions in the hydrogen plasma. The phase velocity of the magnetic fluctuations of the tearing modes is measured with a toroidal array of magnetic pickup coils. Both velocities track each other very closely during the spinup phase between sawtooth events, typically reaching a maximum speed of about 20 km/s. Both slow down at the sawtooth crash within a few tens of microseconds. Locked modes in MST occur coincident with the large impulsive vertical field associated with a sawtooth event; they can also be controllably induced by a negatively biased electrode inserted into the plasma. After the onset of a locked mode the phase velocity of the magnetic fluctuations is zero, while the bulk fluid continues to flow at a velocity of few km/s

N2  - Summary form only given. The spherically convergent ion focus (SCIF) is an alternative plasma confinement scheme in which ions are electrostatically confined, accelerated, and concentrated at fusion-relevant energies. This concept has been recently promoted for various near-term applications including waste disposal, particle production, neutron radiography and tomography, plastic explosive detection, materials research, and medical isotope production. The Wisconsin SCIF experiments are designed to evaluate the practicality of the SCIF concept for given applications. In the experiment, a wire globe serves as a simple means of producing the trapping potential well, and the ion source consists of a cold, uniform plasma (n<sub>i</sub>~10<sup>14</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>) at the edge. Hydrogen ions formed from the background neutral gas (0.1-15 mtorr) are typically accelerated to energies of 5-20 kV, and measured cathode grid currents approach the space-charge limit for concentric spheres. Core size measurements utilize spectrally-filtered CCD camera images of the visible emission from the core region, and the minimal observed core radius of 0.6 cm (HWHM) is within a factor of 2-3 of the theoretical convergence ratio for the device. Neutral particle interactions and potential asymmetries imposed by the grid lead to non-ideal convergence, as evidenced by measured potential asymmetries and core size dependence on cathode grid spacing. Floating probes with 30 kV isolation have allowed unique measurements of the density, electric potential and temperature in the converged core

N2  - Experimental results from the Phaedrus-T tokamak AWCD programme include the first successful demonstration of Alfven wave current drive (with &omega;&lt;&Omega;<sub>i</sub>) in a tokamak. 46 kA of Alfven wave current drive (AWCD)-compared to a total current of 64 kA-has been driven. Alfven wave heating (AWH) of electrons is also demonstrated during H-mode operation (achieved with a biased electrode). Alfven wave excitation is achieved with conventional loop antennas and with a new type of antenna (stacked stripline) which allows very low voltage operation. Antennas have no Faraday screens but employ insulating limiters. Theoretical studies suggest that wave excitation in Phaedrus-T depends on the presence of a minority species. The time dependence of the loop voltage has successfully been modelled. Alfven wave heating and current drive regimes and low frequency fast wave current drive regimes in tokamaks, Phaedrus-T, TPX and ITER have been analysed via the global full wave code, ALFA

N2  - A high-resolution spectrometer has been developed and used on the MST reversed-field pinch (RFP) to measure passively impurity ion temperatures and flow velocities with 10 &mu;s temporal resolution. Such measurements of MHD-scale fluctuations are particularly relevant in the RFP because the flow velocity fluctuation-induced transport of current (the &ldquo;MHD dynamo&rdquo;) may produce the magnetic field reversal characteristic of an RFP. This instrument will also be used to measure rapid changes in the equilibrium flow velocity, such as occur during locking and H-mode transition. The precision of measurements made to date is &lt;0.6 km/s. We are developing accurate analysis techniques appropriate to the reduction of this fast ion dynamics data. Moment analysis and curve-fitting routines have been evaluated for noise sensitivity and robustness. Also presented is an analysis method which correctly separates the flux-surface average of the correlated fluctuations in <b>u</b> and <b>B</b> from the fluctuations due to rigid shifts of the plasma column

N2  - Summary form only given, as follows. A fast and inexpensive spectrometer system has been developed to record EUV impurity spectra in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) Reversed-Field Pinch (RFP). To simplify the vacuum system, light is passed out of the spectrometer's vacuum to the detector using a sodium-salicylate-coated fiber-optic coupler. This coupler is positioned such that the focal field is nearly flat over its aperture, thus minimizing defocusing at the edges of the detection plane. The system's detector is a microchannel-plate-intensified, linear, self-scanning photodiode array. The 1024-pixel array covers a bandwidth of over 80 nm and is read out once every ms. The readout, which is four times faster than the manufacturer's maximum rating, is fully synchronized to the experiment using a locally designed control circuit

N2  - The bulk of the low-amplitude turbulent density fluctuations are found in the range (k<sub>1</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub>)&ap;0.1-0.3 for supershot and L-mode confinement regimes in TFTR. The wavenumber spectrum in the radial direction peaks at k<sub>r</sub>=0, while the poloidal spectrum peaks near k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub>&ap;0.1-0.3, in general agreement with expectations from nonlinear ion drift wave turbulence models. A nonlinear wave-wave coupling analysis indicates a positive linear growth rate at very low k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub>&lt;0.06, and a cascade of energy to the higher-k, shorter-wavelength modes at the peak of the power spectrum. The contrast, the edge region shows additional unstable modes at high k which cascade to the lower k peak. The observed density fluctuation level and corresponding decorrelation lengths and times are sufficient to account for the observed local thermal transport in the plasma confinement region and generally indicate scaling consistent with the local transport, but direct evidence of causality between these fluctuations and transport has not been shown. The relative scalings of fluctuation amplitude versus correlation length do not agree with a simple mixing length scaling in the confinement region. Initial comparisons of fluctuation data for D-D and D-T plasmas indicate that changes in n&macr;/n for r/a&ges;0.5 are less than or comparable to statistical variations in the data, and do not appear to proportionally scale with the decreases in &chi;<sub>i</sub> observed at smaller radii in the plasma

N2  - A two-dimensional analog to the beam emission spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic has been designed to acquire vorticity and plasma flow-field information by resolving the spatial and temporal intermittency of plasma turbulent structures. The beam emission imaging diagnostic measures collisionally induced neutral beam fluorescence to infer local plasma density variations. It consists of a high-throughput, interline-transfer CCD camera viewing, with narrow spectral bandwidth, a 10 cm high diagnostic neutral beam as it traverses the plasma. The camera is coupled to a gated image intensifier that provides for two images with exposure times up to a few ms to be separated by as little as 10 &mu;s. Sensitivity to density fluctuations of &ntilde;/n&gt;1.0% is expected using the Phaedrus-T beam operating at 20-25 keV in He<sup>0</sup> or D<sup>0</sup>

N2  - The &alpha;-CHERS diagnostic is a high throughput charge exchange recombination spectroscopy diagnostic designed to measure the density profile and time evolution of 0-500 keV alpha particles during D-T operation of the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR). Following successful tests with a prototype &alpha;-CHERS system, an improved, multichannel system has been installed for D-T operation. Three spatial channels may be observed simultaneously, and the spectral resolution of 0.5 nm permits increased alpha energy resolution and improved impurity line identification. More efficient coupling optics between the spectrometer and charge coupled device (CCD) detectors have increased the light throughput, and radiation shielding has been installed around the detectors and spectrometers to eliminate the neutron/gamma-ray noise observed in high power D-D plasmas

N2  - A compact, portable, eight-channel, filter spectrometer has been designed for beam emission spectroscopy measurements of long-wavelength density fluctuations on TEXT-U and Phaedrus-T. The system uses radially elongated image volumes which maximize the etendue of the system while still resolving the dominant fluctuations (k<sub>r</sub>&lt;2 cm<sup>-1</sup>, k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&lt;6 cm<sup>-1</sup>). Because of the vertical injection geometry of the TEXT-U diagnostic neutral beam, there is little Doppler shift of the beam emissions and thus a nonhydrogenic species must be used to distinguish between the beam and edge emissions. A He<sup>0</sup> metastable beam has been found to provide good beam penetration with little contamination of the detected beam fluorescence by edge emission. A multistep excitation model is used to quantitatively interpret the fluctuations in the intensity of the He<sup>0</sup> triplet (<sup>3</sup>P<sup>0</sup>-<sup>3</sup>D, 587.6 nm) as plasma density fluctuations

N2  - A high-throughput, high-frequency charge exchange recombination spectroscopy diagnostic (HF-CHERS) has been developed to give localized measurements of ion temperature and parallel velocity microturbulence (T&tilde;<sub>i</sub>, v&tilde;<sub>&par;</sub>) in the plasma core of the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR). HF-CHERS uses an interference filter spectrometer to measure intensity fluctuations simultaneously over several wavelength intervals of the line shape of the n=8-7 transition of C<sup>+5</sup> (529 nm). T&tilde;<sub>i</sub> and v&tilde;<sub>&par;</sub> are deduced from the moments of the emitted line shape. Using the beam emission spectroscopy optics on TFTR, measurements are made with 1-2 &mu;s time resolution and &ap;2 cm spatial resolution. The initial implementation of the diagnostic is expected to be sensitive to temperature fluctuations of T&tilde;/T&ges;1%

N2  - Summary form only given. Convergent ion focus devices have been considered as sources of fusion reactivity since early studies in the late 1960's. In general, these devices rely on the confinement and acceleration of plasma ions in a spherically or cylindrically symmetric electrostatic potential well. Ions at the edge fall into the well and converge to the central core region. This leads to a strongly increasing central density and central ion energies comparable to the depth of the potential well, resulting in considerable fusion reactivity with modest device parameters. Several schemes have been proposed for creating the potential well, with simple transparent spherical grids being the usual experimental realization. Potential applications of these fusion devices range from small low-intensity fusion-product particle sources for nuclear assaying to more intense sources for isotope generation and waste processing. Even more optimistic projections have led to discussions of fusion power generation through electrostatic confinement. Recent experiments and modelling efforts are developing a deeper understanding of the operation of these devices. Near-term future experiments are concentrating on development of nonperturbing diagnostics of the energetic ion core, achieving high core density operation, and testing predictions of flow instabilities

N2  - The implementation of beam emission spectroscopy (BES) on the tokamak TEXT-U was achieved by the construction of a compact, robustly portable, eight-channel filter spectrometer. The wave number spectra of the long wavelength density spectra were experimentally observed to be asymmetric with the poloidal spectra peaked at higher k: [Left angle bracket]k<sub>r</sub>[Right Angle Bracket] &lt;&lt; [Left angle bracket]k<sub>&theta;</sub>[Right Angle Bracket]. This suggested that the higher resolution was needed in the poloidal direction to resolve the fluctuations. The system can be configured with bundles which give symmetric resolution of 6 mm by 6 mm with asymmetric fiber bundles which have poloidal and radial resolutions of 6 and 17 mm, respectively. The spectrum exhibited by the correlation method was characteristic of both TEXT-U and Phaedrus-T. Detailed study showed that the fluctuations in the core region of these machines were very similar to those observed in the edge region of tokamak fusion test reactor.

N2  - A high-throughput, four-spectral-channel, high-frequency charge exchange recombination spectroscopy diagnostic was installed on Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, which will measure localized temperature and parallel velocity fluctuations from investigation of the n=8-7 emission of C<sup>+5</sup>. Comparison with beam emission spectroscopy revealed that sensitivity to temperature fluctuations of &lt;=1% was predicted. The charge exchange line was determined and measured by phase I, and early temperature and change-in-velocity estimates from this diagnostic corresponded well with the results from charge exchange recombination spectroscopy.

N2  - A fast and inexpensive spectrometer system has been developed to record extreme-UV impurity spectra in a magnetic-fusion-research device. To simplify the vacuum system, light is passed out of the spectrometer's vacuum to the detector with a sodium-salicylate-coated, fiber-optic coupler. This coupler is positioned so that the focal field is nearly flat over its aperture. The system's detector is a microchannel-plate-intensified, linear, self-scanning photodiode array. The 1024-pixel array covers a bandwidth greater than 80 nm and is read out once every millisecond. The readout, which is four times faster than the manufacturer's maximum rating, is fully synchronized to the experiment by a locally designed control circuit

N2  - A high-resolution spectrometer has been developed and used to measure simultaneously impurity ion temperatures and flow velocities in high temperature plasmas with 10 &mu;s temporal resolution (limited by digitization rate). This device is actually a duo-spectrometer: measurements from two different chordal views of the plasma can be made simultaneously via two separate quartz input fiber optic bundles coupled to the entrance slits which are tilted to compensate for line curvature. The dispersed spectra on the exit plane of the duo-spectrometer are coupled via quartz fiber optics to two arrays of 16 photomultiplier tubes each. Measurements made by recording the Doppler broadened and shifted 227.091 nm emission from the Cv impurity ions in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed-field pinch (RFP) plasma have achieved precisions of &lt;6 eV for temperatures of 150 eV and &lt;0.7 km/s for flow velocities of 6 km/s. Representative results from the MST RFP indicate that the toroidal flow velocity drops and ion temperature increase during sawtooth events in MST

N2  - A localized transition zone is observed between turbulent, long-wavelength density fluctuations (k<sub>&perp;</sub>&lt;2 cm<sup>-1</sup>) in the core and edge of beam-heated discharges in TFTR. The core turbulence is unimodal while the edge has two counterpropagating modes, both of which are spectrally distinct from the core fluctuations. The fluctuation amplitude in the core scales with the global energy confinement time while in the edge it does not. These observations suggest that distinct modes are responsible for turbulence in the two regions and that only the core mode is directly related to global confinement

N2  - New information on magnetic fluctuations and transport in toroidal devices has been obtained in the MST reversed field pinch through measurement of nonlinear coupling of three waves in k-space, and measurement of current density fluctuations. Measurements of nonlinear coupling of magnetic fluctuations reveal that (1) two poloidal mode number m=1 modes couple strongly to an m=2 mode; (2) toroidal mode coupling is broad, extending up to n&ap;20; (3) these features agree with predictions for tearing fluctuations from a nonlinear MHD code; (4) during a sawtooth crash the number of modes involved in nonlinear interactions increases dramatically and the k-spectrum broadens simultaneously. Measurements of current density fluctuations over the outer 20% of the minor radius reveal that (1) low frequency fluctuations are consistent with tearing modes; (2) high frequency fluctuations are localized turbulence which maintains resonance with the equilibrium field as q changes with radius; (3) particle transport from magnetic fluctuations is ambipolar (i.e. &lang;&delta;j<sub>&par;</sub>&delta;B<sub>r</sub>&rang;&ap;0)

N2  - Anomalous ion heating and superthermal electron populations have been studied in the MST reversed-field pinch. The ion heating is much stronger than that given by classical electron-ion friction, and is particularly strong during dynamo bursts. The heating displays a market density dependence: in a 350 kA discharge with a maximum <i>n</i>&macr;=0.9&times;10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, <i>T</i><sub>i</sub> rises sharply as <i>n</i>&macr; drops below 0.4&times;10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> late in the discharge. Superthermal electrons are produced in the core, with temperatures of <i>T</i><sub>eh</sub>=350-700 eV, while the bulk core temperature is <i>T</i><sub>e0</sub>=130-230 eV. The fraction of superthermal electrons decreases with increasing density, from 40% at <i>n</i>&macr;=0.5&times;10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> to 8% at <i>n</i>&macr;=1.9&times;10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> at <i>I</i>=350 kA. However, data with similar plasma parameters but higher oxygen impurity content had a lower <i>T</i><sub>eh</sub> and a higher hot fraction. The edge superthermal electron distribution is well fit by a drifted bi-Maxwellian distribution with <i>T</i><sub>&par;</sub>~<i>T</i><sub>e0</sub> and relative drift speed &upsi;<sub>d</sub>/&upsi;<sub>th</sub>=0.4. With the assumption that the parallel heat flux measured with a pyroelectric probe is carried by superthermal electrons, the measured electron current is consistent with <i>T</i><sub>&perp;</sub>~<i>T</i><sub>ea</sub>~<i>T</i><sub>e0</sub>/3 and accounts for over half of the total edge parallel current measured with magnetic probes

N2  - Summary form only given. Beam emission spectroscopy (BES) is a diagnostic technique which provides localized measurements of density turbulence in high-temperature magnetically confined plasmas. BES detects local plasma fluctuations by observing intensity fluctuations in collisionally induced neutral beam fluorescence from a diagnostic beam injected into the hot plasma. With this approach it is possible to access the wavelength region of peak fluctuation amplitude in the plasma, and new features of the turbulence spectrum have emerged. For example, a strong anisotropy is observed in the wavenumber spectra perpendicular to the local field, where the radial spectrum peaks at k<sub>4</sub> = 0 cm<sup>-1</sup>, while the poloidal spectrum peaks at k<sup>&thetas;</sup> &ap; 1 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Estimates of turbulence-driven fluxes indicate that the observed fluctuations are sufficient to driven the observed anomalous cross-field transport in tokamak plasmas with strong auxiliary heating

N2  - Plasma density turbulence has been measured with the beam emission spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic system, using a low-power neutral beam with He<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>0</sup> as beam species. In general, He<sup>0</sup> (588 nm) provided the best signal-to-noise ratio due to its lower edge plasma background interference. Simultaneous measurements of edge density fluctuations have been made with BES and Langmuir probes; the spectra are seen to be essentially identical, and the fluctuation amplitudes from both diagnostics are in close agreement. A poloidal coherence length of about 2-4 cm was observed. Radial propagation of modes was not seen, but a lab-frame poloidal phase velocity at <i>r</i>/<i>a</i>=0.77 of about 7&times;10<sup>5</sup> cm/s in the electron diamagnetic direction was observed, corresponding to <i>m</i>=8-75 kHz

N2  - The recently developed technique of beam emission spectroscopy (BES) provides a tool to study long-wavelength density turbulence (coherence length &Gt; ion gyroradius) in hot tokamak plasmas. To provide an accurate conversion of the measured light intensity fluctuations to a local <i>&ntilde;</i>/<i>n</i> density fluctuation and to assess the influence of density fluctuations in the neutral beam induced by large edge turbulence, a multistate neutral beam excitation/transport code for realistic experimental geometries has been written. Results from this code show that the attenuation of the beam density induced by edge turbulence can give rise to significant levels of common-mode fluctuation power in signals from the plasma core and that the derivation of quantitative values of <i>&ntilde;</i>/<i>n</i> from experimental measurements depends weakly on the radial extent of the density fluctuations

N2  - An optical spectroscopy diagnostic has been designed to observe emissions from the nonthermal alpha particle population that will be generated during the D-T operation phase on TFTR. The system will observe spectral line emission near 469 nm from the slowing-down alpha population interacting with the heating neutral beams through charge exchange. The required spectrometer throughput and resolution are obtained by modification of a simple commercial spectrometer system, while a series of measurements indicate that a cooled CCD array is usable as a high-efficiency detector with photon-noise-limited accuracy to roughly a part in 10<sup>4</sup>

N2  - The capability of controlling a diagnostic subsystem and interactively participating in the experimental program on Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) from a remote site has been developed and demonstrated on the TFTR BES experiment. Interactive communications are established from multiscreen remote workstations at the University of Wisconsin to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory VAX cluster via multiple terminal sessions across the InterNet national network. Full control of the diagnostic, access to all relevant machine parameters and wave forms, and operations run logs are all available with automatic updates between plasma shots. A real-time count-down shot clock with timer, machine event status, and shot number provides a real-time interface to the TFTR shot sequence. This means of remote participation in a central fusion experiment provides vital experience for extrapolation to implementation on an ignition device to test engineering concepts

N2  - Previous studies of plasma microturbulence have indicated that the fluctuation power sales with radial wave number, <i>k</i><sub>&perp;</sub>, like <i>k</i><sub>&perp;</sub><sup>-2</sup>&rarr;<i>k</i><sub>&perp;</sub><sup>-3.5</sup> for <i>k</i><sub>&perp;</sub>&gt;2 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This implies that low <i>k</i> fluctuations may dominate the spectrum. Beam emission spectroscopy (BES) has been developed to provide spatially localized measurements of density fluctuations in this low <i>k</i> region of the spectrum (<i>k</i><sub>&perp;</sub>&lt;2 cm<sup>-1</sup>). A 20-channel system has been installed on TFTR which images one of the heating neutral beams (via fiber optics) onto a set of photoconductive photodiode detectors. Fluctuations in the fluorescent <i>D</i><sub>&alpha;</sub> emission from the beam can be related to the local plasma density fluctuations via a model of the atomic excitation processes. The analysis of BES data utilizes many of the standard statistical analysis techniques such as power spectra, coherency and cross phase, and correlation analysis which are also used in the analysis of, for example, Langmuir probe data. In the case of BES however, these techniques require some special modifications to account for systematic effects such as photon statistics and fluctuations in the neutral beam density induced by the strong fluctuations near the plasma edge

N2  - The beam emission spectroscopy optical fluctuation diagnostic requires the highest possible quantum efficiency detector at 656 nm to minimize the photon statistical baseline limit to the detectable fluctuation level. A photoconductive photodiode detector with an extremely low-noise preamplifier and a reactive feedback circuit provides quantum efficiencies up to 70%-80% for a useful frequency range of at least 0-150 kHz with incident powers of ~10 nW. The diodes are chosen for negligible leakage current and hence do not require active cooling. These detectors have provided increase in the sensitivity to plasma fluctuation amplitude by a factor of ~14 over photomultipliers and a factor of 4 over large area avalanche photodiodes

N2  - Toroidal Alfven eigenmodes (TAE) have been excited by tangential neutral beam injection in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) [Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research, 1990, Washington, D.C. (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1990), vol.I, p.9]. Beam emission spectroscopy (BES) has been used to study the radial structure and the poloidal power spectra of these modes. Radial profiles show a global, standing wave structure with a node near <i>r</i>/<i>a</i>=0.6 and a maximum displacement of about 5-10 mm. The cross-phase profiles and the power spectra both imply that the mode is composed of a mixture of components with various poloidal and toroidal mode numbers, as expected for the TAE. Measurements of the poloidal mode spectrum via BES show good agreement with theoretical simulations performed by a nonvariational, kinetic magnetohydrodynamics stability code (NOVA-K [Cheng, Phys. Rep. 211, 1 (1992)]). In particular, the dominant harmonics in the poloidal spectrum obey the expected relation m+1/2&ap;q(r)n

N2  - New beam emission spectroscopy and correlation reflectometry density fluctuation diagnostics on TFTR allow examination of the crucial long wavelength (k<sub>&perp;</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub>&lt;0.1) region, where microwave scattering has indicated where the bulk of the power density lies. The turbulent spectrum for low k is broadband and dominated by low frequencies (&lt;200 KHz), and the exact nature of the spectrum is dominated by Doppler effects. These core diagnostics show &ntilde;/n rising as &tau;<sub>E</sub> decreases. Radial and poloidal correlation lengths from BES are comparable and are roughly 2-3 cm near the plasma edge and gradually drop to 1-2 cm in the region of r/a=0.5-0.7. Values &lt;1.5 cm are indicated deeper in the core region, but precise values await further analysis which takes into account the effects of finite spatial resolution of the BES measurements. A strong anisotropy in the radial and poloidal wavenumber spectra is indicated from the shape of the correlation functions. The poloidal wavenumber spectrum does not increase indefinitely as k goes to 0 cm<sup>-1</sup>, but has a peak in the range of 1-2 cm<sup>-1</sup>

N2  - Production and excitation of hydrogenic light ions in hot plasmas via charge exchange recombination interactions has become the method of choice for the measurements of plasma ion temperatures and rotation velocities. Several atomic physics and environmental effects can conspire to cause perturbations of the measured line profile, and hence reduce the reliability of these measurements. Unresolved atomic fine structure is sometimes nonnegligible and can cause both an artificial asymmetry and broadening of the line. At high magnetic fields, both Zeeman and motional Stark line broadening can make reliable measurements problematic. At the high thermal energies found in contemporary fusion plasmas, the cross section for charge exchange between a plasma ion and a monoenergetic beam neutral can change appreciably across the ion velocity distribution and hence across the line profile. With the proper beam-sightline orientation, this can lead to large and measurable changes in the apparent ion temperatures and rotation velocities

N2  - Summary form only given, as follows. High-frequency observations of light emitted from the interactions between plasma ions and injected neutral beam atoms allow the measurement of moderate-wavelength fluctuations in plasma and impurity ion densities. To detect turbulence in the local plasma ion density, the collisionally excited fluorescence from a neutral beam is measured either separately at several spatial points or with a multichannel imaging detector. Similarly, the role of impurity ion density fluctuations is measured using charge exchange recombination excited transitions emitted by the ion species of interest. This technique can access the relatively unexplored region of long-wavelength plasma turbulence with <i>k</i><sub>&perp;</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub>&Lt;1, and hence complements measurements from scattering experiments. Optimization of neutral beam geometry and optical sightlines can result in very good localization and resolution (&Delta;<i>x</i>&les;1 cm) in the hot plasma core region. The detectable fluctuation level is determined by photon statistics, atomic excitation processes, and beam stability, but can be as low as 0.2% in a 100 kHz bandwidth over the 0-1 MHz frequency range. The choices of beam species (e.g., H<sup>0</sup>, He<sup>0</sup>, etc.), observed transition (e.g., H<sub>&alpha;</sub>, L<sub>&alpha;</sub>, He I singlet or triplet transitions, C VI &Delta;<i>n</i>=1, etc.) are dictated by experiment-specific factors such as optical access, flexibility of beam operation, plasma conditions, and detailed experimental goals.

It consists of a low-power diagnostic neutral beam (H<sup>0</sup> or He<sup>0</sup>) coupled with visible and vacuum UV collection optics to study low-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations in local plasma density in ohmically and RF-heated plasmas. Neutral beam geometry and optical sightlines are chosen to optimize localization and radial resolution (&lt;1 cm) over the whole plasma region. The ability to inject either a H or He neutral beam and observe in both the vacuum UV and the visible spectral ranges allows a wide choice of atomic transitions (e.g H<sub>&alpha;</sub>, L<sub>&alpha;</sub>, He singlet or triplet lines, etc.) to be compared and optimized for a given experimental condition

N2  - A wide variety of spectroscopic techniques exploiting several different atomic processes are used to study the properties of high temperature magnetically confined plasmas. The methods of choice in present experiments use either charge exchange recombination reactions between plasma ions and light neutral atoms injected via high energy neutral beams or fluorescence of beam-injected neutrals excited via collisions with the plasma constituent species. While these techniques allow accurate studies of plasma equilibria, transport properties, and possibly microturbulence in contemporary experiments, the low probability of penetration of neutral beams into dense hot plasmas suggests that extrapolation of these techniques to future fusion ignition experiments may be difficult, and alternative diagnostic techniques based on more classical emission line spectroscopy must also be explored

N2  - The authors compare the spectrum of the regularly spaced photoabsorption resonances which appear in the vicinity of the ionization threshold for atoms in a strong magnetic field with predictions of semiclassical strong-mixing models. Quasi-Landau resonance positions are shown to agree well with a two-dimensional WKB semiclassical hydrogenic model which depicts the resonances as bound states of the electron in the combined Coulomb and magnetic fields and which reduces to the Rydberg levels at low excitation. Simpler treatments based on a modified Bohr atomic model are also discussed. The data include observations in the <i>M</i>=0 even-parity channels of Ba I and Sr I with <i>B</i>=25-40 kG and the <i>M</i>=-1 odd-parity channel of Ba I at <i>B</i>=47 kG. A scaling procedure is used to allow field-independent comparison among the various spectra and models. Although fairly successful in predicting energy positions, none of the models attempts to explain the complex resonance profiles or superposed fine structure, thus indicating the need for a comprehensive quantum-mechanical theory of the diamagnetic strong-mixing regime. The appearance of the quasi-Landau resonances in <i>M</i>=0 even-parity spectra is consistent with the requirement that the states have even parity with respect to reflection along the direction of the magnetic field in order for the resonances to occur

N2  - Observations are reported of quasi-Landau resonances in the even-parity spectra of Ba and Sr near their first ionisation thresholds using two-photon ionisation spectroscopy. The positions and B-dependence of the resonances are found to agree with semiclassical calculations. The resonance profiles of Ba differ greatly from those of Sr

N2  - The beam splitter of the all-reflection Michelson interferometer consists of a combination of three parallel diffraction gratings. This paper extends the analysis of the instrument to include the effects of lateral errors in the grating adjustment (i.e., displacements parallel to the grating faces and perpendicular to the grooves). Such errors are shown to introduce a phase shift independent of wavenumber and proportional to grating order number. Tests of an instrument designed for Fourier transform spectroscopy in the 500-1000-&mu;m spectral range are reported and shown to be in agreement with the analysis. For wavenumbers which pass through the instrument in 2 or more orders, cross-order interference effects are expected to occur which cause rapid variations in the efficiency vs wavenumber curve. This possibility should be eliminated in the design of a practical instrument. The resolution of the test instrument (1.6 cm<sup>-1</sup>) was insufficient to reveal this effect

N2  - The behaviour of highly excited even-parity states of neutral barium in magnetic fields between 20 and 40 kiloGauss have been studied by the technique of absorption spectroscopy out of a laser populated lower level. The energy shifts of the 6s6p<sup>1</sup>P<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>-6s ns <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub> Rydberg series were observed. In regions where the interactions with states of the 5d7d configuration are strong the shift is perturbed to below the hydrogenic value. Diamagnetically induced mixing enhances the intensity of higher members of the <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub> series
