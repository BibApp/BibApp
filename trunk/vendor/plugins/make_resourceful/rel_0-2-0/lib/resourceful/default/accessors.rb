module Resourceful
  # This module contains various methods
  # that are available from actions and callbacks.
  # Default::Accessors and Default::URLs are the most useful to users;
  # the rest are mostly used internally.
  #
  # However, if you want to poke around the internals a little,
  # check out Default::Actions, which has the default Action definitions,
  # and Default::Responses.included, which defines the default response_for[link:classes/Resourceful/Builder.html#M000061] blocks.
  module Default
    # This module contains all sorts of useful methods
    # that allow access to the resources being worked with,
    # metadata about the controller and action,
    # and so forth.
    #
    # Many of these accessors call other accessors
    # and are called by the default make_resourceful actions[link:classes/Resourceful/Default/Actions.html].
    # This means that overriding one method
    # can affect everything else.
    # 
    # This can be dangerous, but it can also be very powerful.
    # make_resourceful is designed to take advantage of overriding,
    # so as long as the new methods accomplish the same purpose as the old ones,
    # everything will just work.
    # Even if you make a small mistake,
    # it's hard to break the controller in any unexpected ways.
    #
    # For example, suppose your controller is called TagsController,
    # but your model is called PhotoTag.
    # All you have to do is override current_model_name:
    #
    #   def current_model_name
    #     "PhotoTag"
    #   end
    #
    # Then current_model will return the PhotoTag model,
    # current_object will call <tt>PhotoTag.find</tt>,
    # and so forth.
    #
    # Overriding current_objects and current_object is particularly useful
    # for providing customized model lookup logic.
    module Accessors
      # Returns an array of all the objects of the model corresponding to the controller.
      # For UsersController, it essentially runs <tt>User.find(:all)</tt>.
      #
      # However, there are a few important differences.
      # First, this method caches is results in the <tt>@current_objects</tt> instance variable.
      # That way, multiple calls won't run multiple queries.
      #
      # Second, this method uses the current_model accessor,
      # which provides a lot of flexibility
      # (see the documentation for current_model for details).
