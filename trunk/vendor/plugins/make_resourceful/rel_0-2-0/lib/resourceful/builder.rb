    #
    # +before+ events are run after any objects are loaded[link:classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000015],
    # but before any database operations or responses.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   before :show, :edit do
    #     @page_title = current_object.title
    #   end

    # are run after the database operations fail.
    #
    # +after+ events are run after the database operations
    # but before any responses.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   after :create_fails, :update_fails do

    #   response_for(*actions) { |format| ... }
    #
    # Sets up a block of code to run
    # instead of the default responses for one or more events.
    #
    # If the block takes a format parameter,
    # it has the same semantics as Rails' +respond_to+ method.
    # Various format methods are called on the format object
    # with blocks that say what to do for each format.
    # For example:
    #
    #   response_for :index do |format|
    #     format.html
    #     format.atom do
    #       headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/atom+xml; charset=utf-8'
    #       render :action => 'atom', :layout => false
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # This doesn't do anything special for the HTML
    # other than ensure that the proper view will be rendered,
    # but for ATOM it sets the proper content type
    # and renders the atom template.
    #
    # If you only need to set the HTML response,
    # you can omit the format parameter.
    # For example:
    #
    #   response_for :new do
    #     render :action => 'edit'
    #   end
    #
    # This is the same as
    #     
    #   response_for :new do |format|
    #     format.html { render :action => 'edit' }
    #   end

    # :call-seq:
    #   publish *formats, options = {}, :attributes => [ ... ]
    #
    # publish allows you to easily expose information about resourcess in a variety of formats.
    # The +formats+ parameter is a list of formats
    # in which to publish the resources.
    # The formats supported by default are +xml+, +yaml+, and +json+,
    # but other formats may be added by defining +to_format+ methods
    # for the Array and Hash classes
    # and registering the mime type with Rails' Mime::Type.register[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Mime/Type.html#M001115].
    # See Resourceful::Serialize for more details..
    #
    # The <tt>:attributes</tt> option is mandatory.
    # It takes an array of attributes (as symbols) to make public.
    # These attributes can refer to any method on current_object;
    # they aren't limited to database fields.
    # For example:
    #
    #   # posts_controller.rb
    #   publish :yaml, :attributes => [:title, :created_at, :rendered_content]
    #
    # Then GET /posts/12.yaml would render
    #
    #   --- 
    #   post: 
    #     title: Cool Stuff
    #     rendered_content: |-
    #       <p>This is a post.</p>
    #       <p>It's about <strong>really</strong> cool stuff.</p>
    #     created_at: 2007-04-28 04:32:08 -07:00
    #
    # The <tt>:attributes</tt> array can even contain attributes
    # that are themselves models.
    # In this case, you must use a hash to specify their attributes as well.
    # For example:
    #
    #   # person_controller.rb
    #   publish :xml, :json, :attributes => [
    #     :name, :favorite_color, {
    #     :pet_cat => [:name, :breed],
    #     :hat => [:type]
    #   }]
    #
    # Then GET /people/18.xml would render
    #
    #   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    #   <person>
    #     <name>Nathan</name>
    #     <favorite-color>blue</favorite_color>
    #     <pet-cat>
    #       <name>Jasmine</name>
    #       <breed>panther</breed>
    #     </pet-cat>
    #     <hat>
    #       <type>top</type>
    #     </hat>
    #   </person>
    #
    # publish will also allow the +index+ action
    # to render lists of objects.
    # An example would be too big,
    # but play with it a little on your own to see.
    #
    # publish takes only one optional option: <tt>only</tt>.
    # This specifies which action to publish the resources for.
    # By default, they're published for both +show+ and +index+.
    # For example:
    #
    #   # cats_controller.rb
    #   publish :json, :only => :index, :attributes => [:name, :breed]
    #
    # Then GET /cats.json would work, but GET /cats/294.json would fail.

    # (e.g. Person would be loaded into <tt>@person</tt>),
    # and all child lookups are scoped so that they're guaranteed to be children of the proper parent.
    #
